# MCP Server Usage Monitoring — Instructions

## Purpose

This skill monitors and audits **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server usage** across your Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR environment. MCP servers are AI-powered tools that enable language models to interact with Microsoft security services — and like any privileged access channel, they require monitoring.

**What this skill tracks:**

| MCP Server | Telemetry Source | Key Identifier |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Microsoft Graph MCP Server** | `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` | AppId = `e8c77dc2-69b3-43f4-bc51-3213c9d915b4` |
| **Sentinel Data Lake MCP** | `CloudAppEvents` | RecordType 403, Interface = `IMcpToolTemplate` |
| **Sentinel Triage MCP** | `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` + `SigninLogs` | AppId = `7b7b3966-1961-47b5-b080-43ca5482e21c` ("Microsoft Defender Mcp") — **dedicated AppId** with full user attribution via delegated cert auth |
| **Azure MCP Server** | `AzureActivity` | No dedicated AppId — uses `DefaultAzureCredential` |
| **Sentinel Data Lake — Direct KQL** | `CloudAppEvents` | RecordType 379, Operation = `KQLQueryCompleted` |
| **Workspace Query Sources (Analytics Tier)** | `LAQueryLogs` | All clients querying Log Analytics workspace |

**What this skill detects:**
- Graph API call volume, trends, and endpoint diversity via MCP
- Sensitive/high-risk Graph endpoint access (PIM, credentials, Identity Protection)
- Sentinel workspace query patterns by client application
- **User vs. Service Principal vs. Agent Identity attribution** across all MCP channels
- **Entra Agent ID detection** — distinguishes AI agent identities from standard SPNs and human users (see [Agent Identity Detection](#agent-identity-detection))
- Azure ARM operations potentially originating from Azure MCP Server
- Non-MCP platform query sources for governance context (Sentinel Engine, Logic Apps)
- **Sentinel Data Lake MCP tool usage** — tool call breakdown (`query_lake`, `list_sentinel_workspaces`, `search_tables`, etc.), success/failure rates, execution duration, tables accessed via `CloudAppEvents` (Purview unified audit)
- **MCP-driven vs Direct KQL delineation** — distinguishes Data Lake queries initiated via MCP tools (RecordType 403, Interface `IMcpToolTemplate`) from direct KQL queries (RecordType 379) and Analytics tier queries (`LAQueryLogs`)
- Anomalous access patterns: new users, new endpoints, volume spikes, error surges
- MCP server usage as a proportion of total workspace activity

**Extended landscape awareness:** Beyond these four actively monitored MCP servers, Microsoft's MCP ecosystem includes 30+ additional servers (Copilot Studio built-in catalog, Power BI, Fabric RTI, Playwright, Security Copilot Agent Creation, and more). See [Extended Microsoft MCP Server Landscape](#extended-microsoft-mcp-server-landscape-reference) for the full catalog, telemetry surfaces, and monitoring expansion priorities.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️

**Before starting ANY MCP usage monitoring analysis:**

1. **ALWAYS enforce Sentinel workspace selection** (see Workspace Selection section below)
2. **ALWAYS ask the user for output mode** if not specified: inline chat summary or markdown file report (or both)
3. **ALWAYS ask the user for time range** if not specified: default to 30 days, configurable
4. **ALWAYS query all MCP telemetry surfaces** — do not skip any MCP server type
5. **ALWAYS include non-MCP workspace context** (Sentinel Engine, Logic Apps) for governance proportion analysis
6. **ALWAYS run independent queries in parallel** for performance
7. **ALWAYS attribute activity to specific users** — never present anonymous aggregates
8. **NEVER conflate non-MCP platform activity with MCP activity** — clearly label categories
9. **ALWAYS check for Agent Identity (Entra Agent ID) callers** — distinguish AI agents from human users and standard SPNs (see [Agent Identity Detection](#agent-identity-detection))
10. **ALWAYS execute pre-authored queries from [Sample KQL Queries](#sample-kql-queries) EXACTLY as written** — substitute only the time range parameter (e.g., `ago(30d)` → `ago(90d)`). These queries encode mitigations for schema pitfalls documented in [Known Pitfalls](#known-pitfalls). Writing equivalent queries from scratch is ❌ **PROHIBITED**

## Agent Identity Detection

**Microsoft Entra Agent ID** (public preview) introduces a **new first-class identity type** for AI agents, distinct from traditional service principals and user accounts. MCP servers may be called by human users, standard SPNs, or Agent Identities — and the telemetry to distinguish them varies by table.

> **Reference:** [What are agent identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/agent-id/identity-platform/what-is-agent-id) | [Agent sign-in and audit logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/agent-id/identity-professional/sign-in-audit-logs-agents) | [Agent OAuth protocols](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/agent-id/identity-platform/agent-oauth-protocols)

### Entra Identity Taxonomy

| Identity Category | Types | MCP Usage Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **Human identities** | User accounts (workforce, external) | User signs into VS Code → MCP server acts on behalf of user (delegated) |
| **Workload identities** | App registrations, service principals, managed identities | Standard SPN authenticates to MCP (client credentials / app-only) |
| **🆕 Agent identities** | Agent Identity, Agent Identity Blueprint, Agent User | AI agent uses MCP via Agent OBO, Autonomous App, or Agent User flow |

### Agent ID Object Types

| Object | What It Is | Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent Identity Blueprint** | Reusable template defining a *class* of agent (e.g., "SOC Triage Agent") | Like an app registration |
| **Agent Identity Blueprint Principal** | SPN created when a blueprint is instantiated in a tenant | Like the SPN for an app registration |
| **Agent Identity** | Special SPN with subtype `agent` — represents a single agent instance | Like a service principal, but agent-specific |
| **Agent User** | Optional user account paired 1:1 with an agent identity (for mailbox, Teams, etc.) | Like a user account, but non-human |

**Architectural detail:** Agent identities are modeled as **single-tenant service principals with an "agent" subtype**. The `objectId` and `appId` always have the **same value** (unlike regular app registrations where they differ).

### Agent Authentication Flows

| Flow | Pattern | When Used | Telemetry Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Agent On-Behalf-Of (OBO)** | Delegated — agent acts on behalf of a signed-in user | User-initiated agents, copilots | `UserId` = human user, `ServicePrincipalId` = agent SPN |
| **Autonomous App Flow** | App-only — agent acts under its own authority (`client_credentials`) | Background agents, scheduled tasks | `ServicePrincipalId` = agent SPN, `UserId` empty |
| **Agent User Flow** | Agent uses its paired agent user account | Agents needing mailbox, Teams access | `UserId` = Agent User (non-human with UPN) |

### How to Detect Agent Identities in Telemetry

**⚠️ Known Limitation (Preview):** `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` does NOT yet distinguish Agent IDs from regular SPNs. Requests from agent identities appear as regular applications with the agent identity in the `AppId` column. Requests from agent users appear as regular users with the agent user ID in `UserId`.

**Detection Strategy:**

| Telemetry Source | Detection Method | Reliability | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Graph API `/beta` `tags`** | Query `/beta/servicePrincipals/{id}?$select=tags` — check for `AgenticApp`, `AIAgentBuilder`, `AgentCreatedBy:CopilotStudio` tags | 🟢 **Most reliable** | ✅ Available now |
| **`AuditLogs`** | Agent lifecycle CRUD operations — filter `OperationName has "agent"` or `InitiatedBy` = `Power Virtual Agents Service` | 🟢 High | ✅ Available now |
| **`AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs`** | Agent sign-ins to resources like `Bot Framework` from Azure internal IPs (`fd00:*`) | 🟢 High | ✅ Available now |
| **`MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`** | Join with sign-in logs to identify agent callers by `AppId`/`ServicePrincipalId` | 🟡 Requires cross-ref | ⚠️ Workaround needed |
| **`SigninLogs`** | New `agentSignIn` resource type; filter by `agent/agentType` | 🟡 Preview-dependent | ✅ Available in preview |
| **Graph API `servicePrincipalType`** | `GET /servicePrincipals?$filter=servicePrincipalType eq 'Agent'` | 🔴 **Not yet reliable** — Copilot Studio agents still show `"Application"` | ⚠️ Preview gap |

> 🔵 **Field-tested finding:** The `servicePrincipalType` property does NOT yet show `"Agent"` for Copilot Studio-created agents — they still return `"Application"` on both `/v1.0` and `/beta`. The **`tags` array on `/beta`** is currently the only reliable programmatic indicator. Key tags: `AgenticApp`, `AIAgentBuilder`, `AgentCreatedBy:CopilotStudio`, `AgenticInstance`.

**Sign-in log filters for agents:**
- Portal: Filter by **Agent type** = `Agent Identity` or `Agent ID user` and **Is Agent** = `Yes`
- Graph API: `$filter=signInEventTypes/any(t: t eq 'servicePrincipal') and agent/agentType eq 'AgentIdentity'`

### MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs — User vs SPN vs Agent Attribution

The `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` table has two identity fields that determine "who" is calling Graph APIs:

| Field | Populated When | Identity Type |
|---|---|---|
| `UserId` | A **human user** (or Agent User) made the request via delegated permissions | User / Agent User |
| `ServicePrincipalId` | A **service principal** (or Agent Identity) made the request via app-only permissions | SPN / Agent Identity |
| `ClientAuthMethod` | Always populated — indicates how the caller authenticated | 0 = public client (user), 1 = client secret (SPN), 2 = certificate (SPN) |
| `Roles` | Populated when app-only (application permissions) | App-only flow indicator |
| `Scopes` | Populated when delegated (user context) | Delegated flow indicator |

**Decision tree for caller attribution:**
```
IF ServicePrincipalId is populated AND UserId is empty:
   → App-only flow: SPN or Agent Identity is the autonomous caller
   → Check ClientAuthMethod: 1 = secret, 2 = certificate
   → Cross-reference ServicePrincipalId with Entra to determine if Agent Identity

IF UserId is populated AND ServicePrincipalId is populated:
   → Delegated flow: User (or Agent User) signed in, SPN is the client app
   → Agent OBO: Agent acts on behalf of user — both fields populated

IF UserId is populated AND ServicePrincipalId is empty:
   → Direct user-delegated flow (e.g., VS Code → Graph MCP)
   → Check if UserId maps to an Agent User (non-human account with UPN)
```

### Products Already Using Agent ID

| Product | Agent ID Usage | Telemetry Fingerprint (Field-Tested) |
|---|---|---|
| **Copilot Studio agents** | Each created agent gets an SPN with agentic tags automatically. Initiated by `Power Virtual Agents Service`. Your user gets added as owner. | AuditLogs: `InitiatedBy` = `Power Virtual Agents Service`, `TargetType` = `ServicePrincipal`. SPN sign-ins to `Bot Framework` from Azure internal IPv6 (`fd00:34f2:*`). Tags: `AgenticApp`, `AgentCreatedBy:CopilotStudio`, `AgenticInstance` |
| **Entra CA Optimization Agent** | Microsoft first-party agent identity | May appear in tenant sign-in logs |
| **Custom AI agents** | Developers can register agents via Agent Identity Blueprint | Will appear as SPNs with agent subtype |

> ⚠️ **Name ambiguity warning:** An SPN named with "Agent" in its display name does NOT mean it's an Agent Identity. Example: "Contoso Agent Tools" is a standard `GitCreatedApp` with `servicePrincipalType: Application` and no agentic tags. Always verify via `/beta` `tags` — never rely on display name alone.

### Impact on This Skill

When running MCP usage monitoring:

1. **Phase 1 (Graph MCP):** Check BOTH `UserId` and `ServicePrincipalId` in Query 1 results — if `ServicePrincipalId` is populated with a non-empty value, an SPN or Agent Identity is calling Graph MCP autonomously
2. **New Phase (Agent Detection):** Run Query 17 to identify Agent Identities in the tenant and cross-reference against MCP callers
3. **Report section:** Include a dedicated "Agent vs User Attribution" breakdown showing how many MCP calls originated from humans, standard SPNs, and Agent Identities
4. **Security flag:** Agent Identities calling sensitive Graph endpoints autonomously (without user OBO context) should be flagged 🟠 — verify authorization

### Known AppIds Reference

#### MCP Servers & AI Agents

| AppId | Service | Telemetry Table | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------------|-------|
| `e8c77dc2-69b3-43f4-bc51-3213c9d915b4` | Microsoft Graph MCP Server for Enterprise | `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` | Read-only Graph API proxy |
| `7b7b3966-1961-47b5-b080-43ca5482e21c` | Sentinel Triage MCP ("Microsoft Defender Mcp") | `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`, `SigninLogs`, `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` | Microsoft first-party AppId, same across all tenants. **Dedicated AppId** — visible in `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` (API calls to `/security/*` endpoints) and `SigninLogs`/`AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` (`AppDisplayName = "Microsoft Defender Mcp"`). Delegated auth with certificate (ClientAuthMethod=2), full user attribution. Scopes: `SecurityAlert.Read.All`, `SecurityIncident.Read.All`, `ThreatHunting.Read.All`. Target resources: Microsoft Graph, WindowsDefenderATP. No local SPN — display name only visible in SigninLogs. 🔴 **Confirmed Feb 2026:** Empirical telemetry investigation identified `7b7b3966` as the Triage MCP AppId via MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs + SigninLogs correlation. |
| `253895df-6bd8-4eaf-b101-1381ec4306eb` | Sentinel Platform Services App Reg | `SigninLogs` | Sentinel-hosted MCP platform |
| `04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46` | Azure MCP Server (local stdio via DefaultAzureCredential → Azure CLI) | `SigninLogs`, `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs`, `LAQueryLogs` | Shared AppId with Azure CLI. In LAQueryLogs, `RequestClientApp` is **empty** (not a unique fingerprint). Azure MCP appends `\n\| limit N` to query text — the only query-level differentiator. Read-only ARM ops don't appear in AzureActivity. 🔄 **Updated Feb 2026:** Previously documented as AppId `1950a258` (AzurePowerShellCredential) with `csharpsdk,LogAnalyticsPSClient` — that fingerprint is obsolete; only 1 occurrence found in 30-day lookback. |
| *(none — uses DefaultAzureCredential)* | Azure MCP Server (local stdio) | `AzureActivity` | ARM **write** operations only; read ops not logged. Claims.appid = `04b07795`. Inherits cred from Azure CLI/VS Code |
| *(no AppId — Purview unified audit)* | Sentinel Data Lake MCP | `CloudAppEvents` | RecordType 403; Interface `IMcpToolTemplate`; tools: `query_lake`, `list_sentinel_workspaces`, `search_tables` |

#### Sentinel MCP Collection Endpoints

| Endpoint URL | Collection | Monitored |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| `https://sentinel.microsoft.com/mcp/data-exploration` | Data Exploration (Data Lake MCP) | ✅ Phase 3 |
| `https://sentinel.microsoft.com/mcp/triage` | Triage (Triage MCP) | ✅ Phase 2 |
| `https://sentinel.microsoft.com/mcp/security-copilot-agent-creation` | Security Copilot Agent Creation | ❌ See [Landscape](#extended-microsoft-mcp-server-landscape-reference) |

#### Client Applications

| AppId | Service | Telemetry Table | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------------|-------|
| `aebc6443-996d-45c2-90f0-388ff96faa56` | Visual Studio Code | `SigninLogs` | VS Code as MCP client → Sentinel |
| `9ba5f2e4-6bbf-4df2-b19b-7f1bcb926818` | PowerPlatform-sentinelmcp-Connector | `SigninLogs` | Copilot Studio → Sentinel MCP |

Azure MCP appends `\n\| limit N` to query text. Shared AppId with manual `az` CLI — disambiguate via query text pattern or session correlation. 🔄 Previously documented as `1950a258` (AzurePowerShellCredential) — that path is obsolete |

#### Portal & Platform Applications (Non-MCP — for context)

| AppId | Service | Telemetry Table | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------------|-------|
| `80ccca67-54bd-44ab-8625-4b79c4dc7775` | M365 Security & Compliance Center (Sentinel Portal) | `LAQueryLogs` | `ASI_Portal`, `ASI_Portal_Connectors` — Sentinel Portal backend, NOT an MCP server |
| `95a5d94c-a1a0-40eb-ac6d-48c5bdee96d5` | Azure Portal — AppInsightsPortalExtension | `LAQueryLogs` | Azure Portal blade for Log Analytics Usage dashboards/workbooks. `RequestClientApp` = `AppInsightsPortalExtension`. Executes billing/usage queries (e.g., `Usage \| where IsBillable`). NOT MCP, NOT VS Code — runs when user opens Workspace Usage Dashboard in browser. No SPN or app registration in tenant (platform-level first-party app). Not in merill/microsoft-info known apps list. |
| `de8c33bb-995b-4d4a-9d04-8d8af5d59601` | PowerPlatform-AzureMonitorLogs-Connector | `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs`, `LAQueryLogs` | Logic Apps → Log Analytics (NOT MCP) |
| `fc780465-2017-40d4-a0c5-307022471b92` | Sentinel Engine (analytics rules, UEBA, Advanced Hunting backend) | `LAQueryLogs` | Built-in scheduled query engine (NOT MCP). Also serves as the **execution backend for Advanced Hunting** — `RequestClientApp = "M365D_AdvancedHunting"` indicates AH queries from Triage MCP, Defender portal, or Security Copilot that hit connected LA tables (see Query 7b). Separate from analytics rules (`RequestClientApp` empty or other values). |

## Extended Microsoft MCP Server Landscape (Reference)

Beyond the four MCP servers actively monitored by this skill, Microsoft's MCP ecosystem includes many additional servers. This section catalogs them for awareness, threat modeling, and future monitoring expansion.

### Sentinel MCP Collections (Microsoft-Hosted)

Microsoft Sentinel exposes **three official MCP collections**, each at a distinct endpoint:

| Collection | Endpoint URL | Purpose | Monitored by This Skill |
|------------|-------------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Data Exploration** | `https://sentinel.microsoft.com/mcp/data-exploration` | `query_lake`, `search_tables`, `list_sentinel_workspaces`, entity analyzer | ✅ Phase 3 (CloudAppEvents) |
| **Triage** | `https://sentinel.microsoft.com/mcp/triage` | Incident triage, Advanced Hunting, entity investigation | ✅ Phase 2 (MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs + SigninLogs — AppId `7b7b3966`) |
| **Security Copilot Agent Creation** | `https://sentinel.microsoft.com/mcp/security-copilot-agent-creation` | Create Microsoft Security Copilot agents for complex workflows | ❌ Not yet monitored |

**Sentinel Custom MCP Tools:** Organizations can create their own MCP tools by exposing saved KQL queries from Advanced Hunting as MCP tools. These execute through the same Sentinel MCP infrastructure and are audited in `CloudAppEvents` (RecordType 403) alongside built-in tools. See [Create custom Sentinel MCP tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/datalake/sentinel-mcp-create-custom-tool).

> 🔵 **Monitoring note:** Custom MCP tools appear in CloudAppEvents with the same RecordType 403 and `IMcpToolTemplate` interface as built-in tools. The `ToolName` field will show the custom tool name, making them visible in Query 21 without modification.

### Power BI MCP Servers

| Server | Type | Endpoint / Repo | Purpose | Telemetry Surface |
|--------|------|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Power BI Remote MCP** | Microsoft-hosted | `https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/mcp/powerbi` | Query Power BI datasets, reports, and workspaces remotely via SSE transport | 🟡 `PowerBIActivity` table (if ingested into Sentinel), Fabric audit logs |
| **Power BI Modeling MCP** | Local (stdio) | [microsoft/powerbi-modeling-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-modeling-mcp) | Local Power BI model operations (DAX queries, schema exploration) | ❌ Local only — no Azure telemetry |

> ⚠️ **Data exfiltration risk:** Power BI Remote MCP provides API-based access to organizational datasets. If an AI agent connects to this endpoint, it can query sensitive business data. Monitor `PowerBIActivity` for unusual access patterns if this table is available in your Sentinel workspace.

### Fabric & Azure Data Explorer MCP Servers

| Server | Type | Endpoint / Repo | Purpose | Telemetry Surface |
|--------|------|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Fabric RTI MCP Server** | Local (stdio) | [microsoft/fabric-rti-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-rti-mcp/) | Query Azure Data Explorer clusters and Fabric Real-Time Intelligence Eventhouses via KQL | 🟡 ADX audit logs, Fabric audit events |
| **Azure MCP Server — Kusto namespace** | Local (stdio) | Part of Azure MCP Server (`azmcp --namespace kusto`) | Manage ADX clusters, databases, tables, and queries via ARM | ✅ Already covered (Azure ARM operations — Phase 4) |
| **Kusto Query MCP** | Copilot Studio built-in | Copilot Studio catalog | KQL query execution from Copilot Studio agents | 🟡 CloudAppEvents (Copilot Studio workload) |

> 🔵 **Note:** The Fabric RTI MCP Server is open-source and runs locally. It authenticates to ADX/Eventhouse using the user's credentials. If your org uses ADX, queries from this MCP would appear in ADX audit logs (`.show queries` / diagnostic logs), NOT in Sentinel `LAQueryLogs`.

### Developer & Productivity MCP Servers

| Server | Type | Repo | Purpose | Telemetry Surface |
|--------|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Playwright MCP** | Local (stdio) | [microsoft/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) (26.9k ⭐) | Browser automation via accessibility tree — enables LLMs to interact with web pages | ❌ Local only — no Azure telemetry |
| **GitHub MCP Server** | Local (stdio) | [github/github-mcp-server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) | GitHub repo operations (issues, PRs, code search) via PAT | ❌ GitHub audit logs only, not in Sentinel |
| **Microsoft Learn Docs MCP** | Cloud-hosted | Certified Copilot Studio connector | Search and fetch official Microsoft Learn documentation | ❌ Public docs, no security data |

### Copilot Studio Built-in MCP Servers (19+ servers)

Microsoft Copilot Studio provides a catalog of built-in MCP servers for agent development. These are Microsoft-managed, cloud-hosted servers that agents can connect to.

**Source:** [Built-in MCP servers catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/mcp-microsoft-mcp-servers)

| Category | MCP Servers | Security Relevance |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Microsoft 365** | Outlook Mail, Outlook Calendar, 365 User Profile, Teams, Word, 365 Copilot (Search) | 🔴 High — email, calendar, user profile access |
| **SharePoint & OneDrive** | SharePoint and OneDrive, SharePoint Lists | 🟠 Medium — file and data access |
| **Administration** | 365 Admin Center | 🔴 High — administrative control plane |
| **Dataverse** | Dataverse MCP | 🟠 Medium — business data access |
| **Dynamics 365** | Sales, Finance, Supply Chain, Service, ERP, Contact Center (6 sub-variants) | 🟡 Low-Medium — business application data |
| **Fabric** | Fabric MCP | 🟠 Medium — analytics data access |
| **Office 365 Outlook** | Contact Management, Email Management, Meeting Management | 🔴 High — email and contact data |
| **Meta-Server** | MCP Management MCP | 🟠 Medium — manages other MCP servers via Dataverse/Graph |

> ⚠️ **Telemetry gap:** Copilot Studio built-in MCP servers are NOT directly visible in `LAQueryLogs` or `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`. Their activity may appear in:
> - `CloudAppEvents` — under Copilot Studio workload (if Purview unified audit is configured)
> - M365 unified audit log — as Copilot Studio agent actions
> - `AuditLogs` — agent identity lifecycle events (creation, modification via `Power Virtual Agents Service`)
> - `AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs` — agent SPN sign-ins to `Bot Framework` from Azure internal IPs (`fd00:*`)
>
> To monitor Copilot Studio agent activity touching these MCP servers, use the **Agent Identity Detection** workflow (Phase 6) to identify agent SPNs, then trace their sign-in and audit activity.

### Azure MCP Server — Full Tool Surface

The Azure MCP Server (already tracked in Phase 4) has a much broader tool surface than just ARM operations. The complete namespace catalog:

| Category | Namespaces | Security-Relevant Tools |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| **AI & ML** | `foundry`, `search`, `speech` | AI Foundry model access, Search index queries |
| **Identity** | `role` | ⚠️ RBAC role assignments — view and manage |
| **Security** | `keyvault`, `appconfig`, `confidentialledger` | 🔴 Key Vault secrets/keys/certs, App Configuration |
| **Databases** | `cosmos`, `mysql`, `postgres`, `redis`, `sql` | Database access and management |
| **Storage** | `storage`, `fileshares`, `storagesync`, `managedlustre` | Blob, file, and storage account access |
| **Compute** | `appservice`, `functionapp`, `aks` | App Service, Functions, Kubernetes |
| **Networking** | `eventhubs`, `servicebus`, `eventgrid`, `communication`, `signalr` | Messaging and event services |
| **DevOps** | `bicepschema`, `deploy`, `monitor`, `workbooks`, `grafana` | Infrastructure deployment, monitoring |
| **Governance** | `policy`, `quota`, `resourcehealth`, `cloudarchitect` | Policy management, resource health |
| **Other** | `marketplace`, `virtualdesktop`, `loadtesting`, `acr` | VDI, container registry, load testing |

> 🔵 **Key Vault access via MCP** is particularly security-sensitive. The Azure MCP Server implements **elicitation** (user confirmation prompts) before returning secrets. However, this can be bypassed with the `--insecure-disable-user-confirmation` flag. Monitor `AzureActivity` for Key Vault operations correlated with MCP usage patterns.

### Monitoring Expansion Priorities

If expanding this skill's coverage, prioritize based on data access risk:

| Priority | Server | Why | How to Monitor |
|----------|--------|-----|----------------|
| 🔴 **P1** | Copilot Studio built-in M365 MCPs | Email, Teams, admin center access | Agent Identity Detection (Phase 6) + CloudAppEvents |
| 🔴 **P1** | Security Copilot Agent Creation | Creates autonomous security agents | CloudAppEvents for agent creation events |
| 🟠 **P2** | Power BI Remote MCP | Dataset query access via API | `PowerBIActivity` table if available |
| 🟠 **P2** | Sentinel Custom MCP Tools | User-defined tools, same audit surface | Already visible in Phase 3 CloudAppEvents |
| 🟡 **P3** | Fabric RTI MCP | ADX/Eventhouse data access | ADX diagnostic logs |
| 🟡 **P3** | Kusto Query MCP (Copilot Studio) | KQL from Copilot Studio agents | CloudAppEvents (Copilot Studio workload) |
| ⚪ **P4** | Playwright, GitHub, Learn Docs MCPs | Local/public, minimal telemetry | Not monitorable from Sentinel |

> **Note:** This catalog reflects the Microsoft MCP ecosystem as of February 2026. The [Copilot Studio MCP catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/mcp-microsoft-mcp-servers) notes: *"This list isn't exhaustive. New MCP connectors are added regularly."*

## ⛔ MANDATORY: Sentinel Workspace Selection

**This skill requires a Sentinel workspace to execute queries. Follow these rules STRICTLY:**

### When invoked from another skill (e.g., incident-investigation):
- Inherit the workspace selection from the parent investigation context
- If no workspace was selected in parent context: **STOP and ask user to select**

### When invoked standalone (direct user request):
1. **ALWAYS call `list_sentinel_workspaces` MCP tool FIRST**
2. **If 1 workspace exists:** Auto-select, display to user, proceed
3. **If multiple workspaces exist:**
   - Display all workspaces with Name and ID
   - ASK: "Which Sentinel workspace should I use for this analysis?"
   - **⛔ STOP AND WAIT** for user response
   - **⛔ DO NOT proceed until user explicitly selects**
4. **If a query fails on the selected workspace:**
   - **⛔ DO NOT automatically try another workspace**
   - STOP and report the error, display available workspaces, ASK user to select

**🔴 PROHIBITED ACTIONS:**
- ❌ Selecting a workspace without user consent when multiple exist
- ❌ Switching to another workspace after a failure without asking
- ❌ Proceeding with analysis if workspace selection is ambiguous

---

## Output Modes

This skill supports two output modes. **ASK the user which they prefer** if not explicitly specified. Both may be selected.

### Mode 1: Inline Chat Summary (Default)
- Render the full MCP usage analysis directly in the chat response
- Includes ASCII tables, trend charts, endpoint breakdowns, and security assessment
- Best for quick review and interactive follow-up questions

### Mode 2: Markdown File Report
- Save a comprehensive report to `reports/mcp-usage/MCP_Usage_Report_<timestamp>.md`
- All ASCII visualizations render correctly inside markdown code fences (` ``` `)
- Includes all data from inline mode plus additional detail sections
- Use `create_file` tool — NEVER use terminal commands for file output
- **Filename pattern:** `reports/mcp-usage/MCP_Usage_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`

### Markdown Rendering Notes
- ✅ ASCII tables, box-drawing characters, and bar charts render perfectly in markdown code blocks
- ✅ Unicode block characters (▓░█) display correctly in monospaced fonts
- ✅ Emoji indicators (🔴🟢🟡⚠️✅) render natively in GitHub-flavored markdown
- ✅ Standard markdown tables (`| col |`) render as formatted tables
- **Tip:** Wrap all ASCII art in triple-backtick code fences for consistent rendering

## Scalability & Token Management

This skill was developed in a small lab environment (1–2 users, single workspace). In larger tenants with many users, MCP servers, and higher query volumes, the **query complexity is not a concern** — all queries use `summarize`, `dcount`, `make_set(..., N)`, and `take` operators, so result sets remain bounded regardless of raw table size. Execution time will increase but output shape stays the same.

The **primary risk in large environments is LLM token exhaustion** during report generation. All query results accumulate in conversation context before the report is written, and this skill file itself consumes significant context. In a large tenant, richer result sets (more users, endpoints, error categories, AppIds) can push past token limits before the report is complete.

### Guardrails for Large Environments

**1. Tighten result set limits in queries:**

| Parameter | Small Env (default) | Large Env |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------|
| `make_set(..., N)` for users | 10 | 5 |
| `make_set(..., N)` for endpoints | 20–30 | 10 |
| `make_set(..., N)` for errors | 5 | 3 |
| `take` on governance tables | 25 | 15 |
| `take` on endpoint rankings | 25 | 15 |
| `take` on error analysis | 50 | 20 |

**2. Incremental file writes (markdown mode):**

Instead of composing the entire report in memory and writing it in one `create_file` call:
- Write the report header and executive summary first with `create_file`
- Append each section (Graph MCP, Sentinel Triage, Data Lake, etc.) using `replace_string_in_file` to insert content at the end of the file
- This allows earlier query results to fall out of active context after being written

**3. Two-pass approach for very large tenants:**

- **Pass 1 (Summary):** Run all queries with aggressive limits (`take 10`, `make_set(..., 3)`). Generate a summary report with top-level numbers only.
- **Pass 2 (Drill-down):** If the user wants detail on a specific section (e.g., "show me the full Data Lake error breakdown"), run targeted queries for that section only.

**4. Parallel query batching:**

Phases 1–5 contain independent queries — always run them in parallel. But avoid running all ~16 queries simultaneously; batch them into 2–3 groups of 5–6 queries. This balances throughput against context accumulation.

**5. Omit raw query appendix for large reports:**

The "Appendix: Query Details" section listing every KQL query used can be omitted in large environments to save tokens. The queries are documented in this skill file and don't need to be repeated in the report.

### Indicators You're Hitting Token Limits

- Report generation starts but cuts off mid-section
- The agent switches to a new conversation turn unexpectedly during report writing
- Sections become progressively less detailed toward the end of the report
- The agent summarizes findings in chat instead of writing the full markdown file

If any of these occur, ask the agent to: "Continue writing the report from where you left off" — the incremental file write approach ensures partial progress is saved.

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

When a user requests MCP usage monitoring:

1. **Select Workspace** → `list_sentinel_workspaces`, auto-select or ask
2. **Determine Output Mode** → Ask if not specified: inline, markdown file, or both
3. **Determine Time Range** → Ask if not specified; default 30 days
4. **Run Phase 1 (Graph MCP)** → Daily usage summary, top endpoints, sensitive API access
5. **Run Phase 2 (Sentinel Triage MCP)** → API calls via AppId `7b7b3966`, auth events, AH downstream queries
6. **Run Phase 3 (Sentinel Data Lake MCP)** → CloudAppEvents tool usage, error analysis, MCP vs Direct KQL
7. **Run Phase 4 (Azure MCP & ARM)** → ARM operations, resource provider breakdown
8. **Run Phase 5 (Workspace Governance)** → All query sources (Analytics + Data Lake tiers), MCP proportion
9. **Run Phase 6 (Agent Identity)** → Entra Agent ID detection, caller attribution
10. **Run Phase 7 (Assessment)** → Compute MCP Usage Score, security assessment, render report

**Parallel execution:** Phases 1-5 contain independent queries — run all of them in parallel for performance. Phases 6-7 depend on results from 1-5.

## MCP Usage Score Formula

The MCP Usage Score is a composite health and risk indicator that summarizes MCP server activity. Unlike the Drift Score (which is a ratio), this is an absolute assessment based on multiple dimensions.

### Scoring Dimensions

$$
\text{MCPUsageScore} = \sum_{i} \text{DimensionScore}_i
$$

Each dimension contributes 0–20 points to a maximum of 100:

| Dimension | Max Points | Green (0-5) | Yellow (6-12) | Red (13-20) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **User Diversity** | 20 | 1-2 known users | 3-5 users or 1 unknown | >5 users or unknown users |
| **Endpoint Sensitivity** | 20 | 0% sensitive endpoints | 1-30% sensitive | >30% calls to sensitive APIs |
| **Error Rate** | 20 | <1% errors | 1-5% errors | >5% errors |
| **Volume Anomaly** | 20 | Within ±50% of daily avg | 50-200% spike | >200% spike vs avg |
| **Off-Hours Activity** | 20 | <5% off-hours | 5-20% off-hours | >20% calls outside business hours |

### Interpretation Scale

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **0–25** | Healthy | ✅ Normal MCP usage, no concerns |
| **26–50** | Elevated | 🟡 Review — minor anomalies detected |
| **51–75** | Concerning | 🟠 Investigate — multiple risk signals present |
| **76–100** | Critical | 🔴 Immediate review — significant security risk |

### Sensitivity Classification

**Sensitive Graph API endpoints** — flag any MCP calls to these patterns:

```
roleManagement, roleAssignments, roleEligibility,
authentication/methods, identityProtection, riskyUsers,
riskDetections, conditionalAccess, servicePrincipals,
appRoleAssignments, oauth2PermissionGrants,
auditLogs, directoryRoles, privilegedAccess,
security/alerts, security/incidents
```

### Off-Hours Definition

Business hours: **08:00–18:00 local time** (derive from user's primary sign-in timezone, or use UTC if unknown). Weekends count as off-hours for all 24 hours.

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Graph MCP Server Analysis

**Data source:** `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`  
**Filter:** `AppId == "e8c77dc2-69b3-43f4-bc51-3213c9d915b4"`

Collect:
- **Execute Query 1** to get daily usage summary with user count, success/error breakdown, avg duration
- **Execute Query 2** to get top 25 Graph API endpoints accessed with call counts and last-used timestamps
- **Execute Query 3** to get sensitive/high-risk endpoint access with user and scope details
- **Execute Query 4** to discover all distinct AppIds calling Graph API for MCP identification

### Phase 2: Sentinel Triage MCP Analysis

**Data sources:** `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`, `SigninLogs`, `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs`  
**Filter:** AppId = `7b7b3966-1961-47b5-b080-43ca5482e21c` ("Microsoft Defender Mcp")

**Detection Method (Confirmed Feb 2026):**

The Sentinel Triage MCP has a **dedicated AppId** (`7b7b3966-1961-47b5-b080-43ca5482e21c`) that appears in both `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` and `SigninLogs`/`AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs`. This enables **definitive attribution** of Triage MCP calls — no heuristics or shared-surface estimation needed.

**Key characteristics:**
- **AppDisplayName:** "Microsoft Defender Mcp" (visible in SigninLogs)
- **Auth type:** Delegated + certificate (ClientAuthMethod=2) — user identity always available
- **Scopes:** `SecurityAlert.Read.All`, `SecurityIncident.Read.All`, `ThreatHunting.Read.All`
- **Target resources:** Microsoft Graph, WindowsDefenderATP
- **API endpoints:** POST `/v1.0/security/runHuntingQuery/`, GET `/security/incidents/`, GET `/security/alerts_v2/`
- **No local SPN:** Microsoft first-party app — display name only visible in SigninLogs, not in Graph API SPN lookup

> 🔵 **`MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` retention** varies by environment (depends on Log Analytics workspace configuration and diagnostic settings). Do not assume a fixed retention period — check with a baseline row count query first.

Collect:
- **Execute Query 5** to get authentication events by client app (VS Code, Copilot Studio, browser) with user, IP, OS, country
- **Execute Query 6** to get client app usage breakdown with distinct user counts and last-seen timestamps
- **Execute Query 7** to get Triage MCP API usage from `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` — filter by AppId `7b7b3966` for exact Triage MCP calls with endpoint/method/user breakdown
- **Execute Query 7a** to get Triage MCP authentication events from `SigninLogs`/`AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` — sign-in frequency, user attribution, IP, OS, country
- **Execute Query 7b** to get LAQueryLogs for Advanced Hunting downstream queries via `fc780465` / `M365D_AdvancedHunting`. Captures queries from any `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` consumer (Triage MCP, Defender portal, Security Copilot) that hit connected LA tables. XDR-native tables (DeviceEvents, EmailEvents) don't appear here.
- **Execute Query 7c** to get portal/platform query volume from LAQueryLogs for governance context

### Phase 3: Sentinel Data Lake MCP Analysis

**Data source:** `CloudAppEvents` (Purview unified audit log)  
**Execution tool:** `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` — queries use `TimeGenerated` (Data Lake column). `CloudAppEvents` is available on both Data Lake (90d retention) and Advanced Hunting (30d, uses `Timestamp`). **Always try Data Lake first** for full retention coverage.  
**Filter:** `ActionType contains "Sentinel"` or `ActionType contains "KQL"`. RecordType is inside `RawEventData` (not a top-level column) — extract with `parse_json(tostring(RawEventData)).RecordType`. RecordType 403 = MCP tools, 379 = Direct KQL.

**⚠️ MANDATORY:** Execute Query 20 against `query_lake` before reporting any gap. If the query returns 0 results or table-not-found, THEN report the gap. Do NOT skip this phase based on assumptions about E5 licensing or Purview configuration — the table may be populated even without explicit Purview setup.

**Audit Path:** Sentinel Data Lake MCP tools are NOT audited via `LAQueryLogs` — they are tracked through Purview unified audit log, surfaced in the `CloudAppEvents` table. RecordType 403 (inside `RawEventData`) = Sentinel AI Tool activities, RecordType 379 = KQL activities.

**MCP vs Direct KQL Delineation:**

| Access Pattern | RecordType | Interface | Operation | What It Represents |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MCP Server-driven** | 403 | `IMcpToolTemplate` | `SentinelAIToolRunStarted`, `SentinelAIToolRunCompleted` | Tool calls via Sentinel Data Lake MCP (e.g., `query_lake`, `list_sentinel_workspaces`, `search_tables`) |
| **Direct KQL** | 379 | `Microsoft.SentinelGraph.AIPrimitives.Core.Services.KqsService` | `KQLQueryCompleted` | KQL queries executed directly via Sentinel Graph / Data Lake Explorer (no MCP intermediary) |

**Key `RawEventData` Fields:**

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `ToolName` | MCP tool invoked | `query_lake`, `list_sentinel_workspaces`, `search_tables`, `analyze_url_entity` |
| `Interface` | Execution interface — distinguishes MCP from direct | `IMcpToolTemplate` (MCP) vs `KqsService` (direct) |
| `ExecutionDuration` | Duration in seconds (as string) | `"2.4731712"` |
| `FailureReason` | Error message if failed | `"SemanticError: 'DeviceDetail' column does not exist"` |
| `TablesRead` | Tables accessed by the query | `"SigninLogs"` |
| `DatabasesRead` | Log Analytics workspace name | `"la-yourworkspace"` |
| `TotalRows` | Rows returned | `100` |
| `InputParameters` | Full tool input including KQL query text and workspaceId | JSON string with `query` and `workspaceId` keys |

Collect:
- **Execute Query 20** to get Data Lake MCP tool usage summary with success/failure breakdown
- **Execute Query 21** to get tool-level breakdown with call counts and avg execution duration
- **Execute Query 22** to get error analysis for failed Data Lake MCP tool calls
- **Execute Query 23** to get daily activity trend across MCP and Direct KQL
- **Execute Query 24** to get MCP vs Direct KQL delineation summary

### Phase 4: Azure MCP Server & ARM Operations

**Data sources:** `AzureActivity`, `SigninLogs`, `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs`, `LAQueryLogs`  
**Filter:** Caller = user UPN (AzureActivity), AppId = `04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46` (sign-in logs, LAQueryLogs)

Collect:
- **Execute Query 8** to get ARM operations by hour/IP with operation counts and resource provider sets
- **Execute Query 9** to get resource provider breakdown with top operations per provider
- **Execute Query 25** to get **Azure MCP Server authentication events** from SigninLogs/AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs — filter by AppId `04b07795` (Azure CLI credential, field-tested Feb 2026). 🔄 Previously documented as AppId `1950a258` (AzurePowerShellCredential) — that path is obsolete.
- **Execute Query 26** to get **Azure MCP Server workspace queries** from LAQueryLogs — filter by AADClientId `04b07795`. `RequestClientApp` is **empty** (not a unique fingerprint). Azure MCP appends `\n| limit N` to query text — use query text pattern as differentiator.

**Detection Method (🔄 Updated Feb 2026):**

The Azure MCP Server runs as a local .NET process (stdio mode) and authenticates via `DefaultAzureCredential`. **Field-tested Feb 2026:** The credential chain now resolves to **Azure CLI credential** (`04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46`), NOT `AzurePowerShellCredential` (`1950a258`) as previously documented.

**Previous fingerprint (OBSOLETE):** AppId `1950a258` + `RequestClientApp = csharpsdk,LogAnalyticsPSClient`. Only 1 occurrence found in 30-day lookback. The Azure MCP Server SDK path has changed.

**Current fingerprint (field-tested Feb 2026):**

| Signal | Azure MCP Server (Current) | Azure CLI (Manual) | Notes |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **AppId** (SigninLogs) | `04b07795` | `04b07795` | Shared — not a unique differentiator |
| **AADClientId** (LAQueryLogs) | `04b07795` | `04b07795` | Shared |
| **RequestClientApp** (LAQueryLogs) | **Empty** (`""`) | **Empty** (`""`) | Shared — not a unique differentiator. Empty `RequestClientApp` is also used by 4+ other AADClientIds |
| **Query text pattern** (LAQueryLogs) | Appends `\n\| limit N` to all queries | No standard suffix | ✅ **Best differentiator** — Azure MCP `monitor_workspace_log_query` always appends a limit operator |
| **AzureActivity** (Claims.appid) | `04b07795` (write ops only) | `04b07795` | Shared; read ops not logged |

**🚨 Key change from previous documentation:**
- ❌ `RequestClientApp = "csharpsdk,LogAnalyticsPSClient"` — **OBSOLETE**, no longer produced by Azure MCP Server
- ❌ AppId `1950a258` (AzurePowerShellCredential) — **OBSOLETE** credential path
- ✅ AppId `04b07795` (Azure CLI) — current credential path
- ✅ `RequestClientApp` is empty — shared with Azure CLI and other tools
- ✅ Query text containing `\n| limit` — most reliable query-level differentiator

**Disambiguation challenges:**
- Azure MCP Server queries are **difficult to isolate** from manual Azure CLI queries in LAQueryLogs because both share the same AppId AND empty `RequestClientApp`
- The `\n| limit N` suffix appended by `monitor_workspace_log_query` is the best heuristic but is not guaranteed to be unique
- In SigninLogs, UserAgent containing `azsdk-net-Identity` with OS `Microsoft Windows` may still help if the credential chain includes Azure Identity SDK components
- Consider correlating query timing with known MCP session activity for attribution

**Authentication Sequence Observed (Current):**
1. Azure MCP Server acquires token via Azure CLI cached credential
2. Token is reused for subsequent operations within its lifetime
3. If MFA claim is missing → interactive browser prompt (rare with CLI credential)
4. Subsequent calls reuse the cached token until expiry

**🔴 Token Caching Behavior (Field-Tested Feb 2026):**
- Sign-in events appear at **token acquisition time**, NOT at each individual API call time
- Once a token is cached, subsequent Azure MCP calls (list resources, get configs, etc.) do NOT generate new sign-in events
- You will see 1-3 sign-in events per token lifecycle, not one per API call
- To count actual API calls, correlate with AzureActivity (write ops) or LAQueryLogs (`monitor_workspace_log_query` calls)
- The ~1hr token lifetime means at most ~24 sign-in event clusters per day of continuous use

**AzureActivity visibility:** Only ARM **write/action/delete** operations appear in AzureActivity (Administrative category). Azure MCP Server read-only operations (list subscriptions, list resource groups, list clusters) do NOT appear. Claims.appid = `04b07795` when write operations do occur. AzureActivity has a ~2-4 hour ingestion lag.

**Note:** Azure MCP Server is **difficult to isolate** from manual Azure CLI usage because they share the same AppId and both produce empty `RequestClientApp`. The `\n| limit N` query text suffix is the best heuristic for LAQueryLogs. In SigninLogs, the shared AppId means Azure MCP authenticated as Azure CLI — there is no unique sign-in fingerprint. Present findings as "Azure MCP Server / Azure CLI (shared AppId `04b07795`)" in reports.

### Phase 5: Workspace Query Governance

**Data source:** `LAQueryLogs` (Analytics tier), `CloudAppEvents` (Data Lake tier)  
**Filter:** All AADClientIds (LAQueryLogs), All Sentinel operations (CloudAppEvents)

Collect:
- **Execute Query 10** to get all clients querying the Analytics tier workspace with query counts, user counts, CPU usage
- Data Lake tier query volume from Phase 3 results (Queries 20-24)
- MCP proportion calculation: combined MCP query volume (Analytics + Data Lake tiers) / total query volume
- **Execute Query 14** to get non-MCP platform context (Sentinel Engine, Logic Apps, Sentinel Portal volumes)

### Phase 6: Agent Identity Detection

**Data sources:** `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`, `AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs`, `AuditLogs`, Microsoft Graph API

Collect:
- **Execute Query 17** to get Graph MCP caller attribution — User vs SPN vs Agent breakdown
- Agent Identity inventory via Graph API — `GET /servicePrincipals?$filter=servicePrincipalType eq 'Agent'` (via Graph MCP `microsoft_graph_suggest_queries` → `microsoft_graph_get`)
- **Execute Query 18** to get Agent Identity sign-in events from `AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs` where applicable
- **Execute Query 19** to get Agent Identity CRUD operations from `AuditLogs` — creation, modification, deletion of agent identities

**Note:** This phase depends on Entra Agent ID (preview) being available in the tenant. If no agent identities exist, report: "✅ No Entra Agent Identities detected in tenant — all MCP callers are standard users or service principals." and skip Queries 18-19.

### Phase 7: Score Computation & Report Generation

1. **Compute per-dimension scores** from Phase 1-6 data:
   - **User Diversity:** Count distinct users AND distinct Agent Identities across all MCP channels
   - **Endpoint Sensitivity:** % of Graph MCP calls to sensitive patterns (Phase 1 Query 3 vs Query 1)
   - **Error Rate:** % of non-2xx responses across all MCP channels
   - **Volume Anomaly:** Compare most recent day vs rolling average (Phase 1 Query 1 daily data)
   - **Off-Hours Activity:** % of MCP calls outside 08:00-18:00 (derive from TimeGenerated)
2. **Sum dimension scores** for composite MCP Usage Score
3. **Include Agent Identity attribution** in report if any agent callers detected (Phase 6)
4. **Generate security assessment** with emoji-coded findings
5. **Render output** in the user's selected mode

## Sample KQL Queries

> 🔴 **MANDATORY: Execute these queries EXACTLY as written.** Substitute only the time range parameter (e.g., `ago(30d)` → `ago(90d)`) and entity-specific values where indicated. These queries are schema-verified and encode mitigations for pitfalls documented in [Known Pitfalls](#known-pitfalls). Rewriting, paraphrasing, or constructing "equivalent" queries from scratch risks hitting the exact schema issues these queries were designed to avoid.

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Rewriting a pre-authored query from scratch | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Removing `parse_json()` / `tostring()` wrappers from queries | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Substituting column names without schema verification | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Using `has` instead of `contains` for CamelCase fields | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Executing a query not from this section without completing the [Pre-Flight Checklist](../../copilot-instructions.md#-kql-query-execution---pre-flight-checklist) | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |

### Query 1: Graph MCP — Daily Usage Summary

```kql
// Graph MCP daily usage trend with success/error breakdown
// Configurable: replace ago(30d) with desired lookback
MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
| where AppId == "e8c77dc2-69b3-43f4-bc51-3213c9d915b4"
| summarize 
    Requests = count(),
    DistinctUsers = dcount(UserId),

    ErrorCount = countif(ResponseStatusCode >= 400),
    AvgDurationMs = avg(DurationMs)
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| extend ErrorRate = round(100.0 * ErrorCount / Requests, 1)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 2: Graph MCP — Top Endpoints Accessed

```kql
// Most-called Graph API endpoints via MCP, with user and recency info
MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
| where AppId == "e8c77dc2-69b3-43f4-bc51-3213c9d915b4"
| extend Endpoint = tostring(split(RequestUri, "?")[0])
| summarize 
    CallCount = count(),
    DistinctUsers = dcount(UserId),
    LastUsed = max(TimeGenerated),
    Methods = make_set(RequestMethod, 5)
    by Endpoint
| order by CallCount desc
| take 25
```

### Query 3: Graph MCP — Sensitive API Access

```kql
// Flag MCP calls to high-risk Graph endpoints (PIM, credentials, Identity Protection)
let sensitive_patterns = dynamic([
    "roleManagement", "roleAssignments", "roleEligibility",
    "authentication/methods", "identityProtection", "riskyUsers",
    "riskDetections", "conditionalAccess", "servicePrincipals",
    "appRoleAssignments", "oauth2PermissionGrants",

| project TimeGenerated, UserId, RequestMethod, RequestUri, 
    ResponseStatusCode, IPAddress, Scopes
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 4: All Graph API AppIds — Discovery

```kql
// Discover all apps calling Graph APIs — find unknown MCP servers or AI agents

    SampleEndpoints = make_set(tostring(split(RequestUri, "?")[0]), 3)
    by AppId
| order by RequestCount desc
```

### Query 5: Sentinel MCP — Authentication Events

**⚠️ Pitfall-aware:** Uses `parse_json(Status)` and `parse_json(DeviceDetail)` wrappers — see [SigninLogs Status Field Needs parse_json()](#signinlogs-status-field-needs-parse_json-in-data-lake). Direct dot-notation fails in Data Lake.

```kql
// Who is authenticating to Sentinel MCP (via VS Code, Copilot Studio, browser)
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
| where ResourceDisplayName =~ "Sentinel Platform Services"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, AppId,

    tostring(parse_json(DeviceDetail).operatingSystem) as OS,
    tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).countryOrRegion) as Country
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 6: Sentinel MCP — Client App Breakdown

```kql
// Which client apps (VS Code, Copilot Studio, browser) are accessing Sentinel MCP
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
| where ResourceDisplayName =~ "Sentinel Platform Services"
| summarize 
    SignInCount = count(),

    Users = make_set(UserPrincipalName, 10),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by AppDisplayName, AppId, ClientAppUsed
| order by SignInCount desc
```

### Query 7: Sentinel Triage MCP — API Call Activity (Dedicated AppId)

```kql
// Measure Sentinel Triage MCP API calls via its dedicated AppId in MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs.
// AppId 7b7b3966 = "Microsoft Defender Mcp" — the Triage MCP server's own identity.
// This gives DEFINITIVE attribution of Triage MCP calls — no shared-surface estimation needed.
//
// Confirmed Feb 2026: AppId 7b7b3966 appears in MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs with delegated
// auth (certificate), full UserId attribution, and scopes SecurityAlert.Read.All,
// SecurityIncident.Read.All, ThreatHunting.Read.All.
//
// Known API endpoints:
//   - POST /v1.0/security/runHuntingQuery/ (Advanced Hunting)
//   - GET  /security/incidents/ (ListIncidents, GetIncidentById)
//   - GET  /security/alerts_v2/ (ListAlerts, GetAlertById)
let triage_mcp_appid = "7b7b3966-1961-47b5-b080-43ca5482e21c";

    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by RequestMethod, Endpoint
| order by Calls desc
| take 25
```

### Query 7a: Sentinel Triage MCP — Authentication Events (SigninLogs)

```kql
// Triage MCP authentication events from SigninLogs + AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs.
// AppId 7b7b3966 = "Microsoft Defender Mcp" — delegated auth with certificate.
// Uses parse_json() wrappers for DeviceDetail/LocationDetails (Data Lake string columns).
let triage_mcp_appid = "7b7b3966-1961-47b5-b080-43ca5482e21c";
let signinlogs_interactive = SigninLogs

### Query 7b: LAQueryLogs — Advanced Hunting Downstream Queries (Supplementary Signal)

```kql
// SUPPLEMENTARY detection: Advanced Hunting queries (from Triage MCP, Defender portal,
// Security Copilot, or any RunAdvancedHuntingQuery consumer) that hit connected
// Log Analytics workspace tables.
//
// AH downstream queries appear under fc780465 (Sentinel Engine) with
// RequestClientApp "M365D_AdvancedHunting" — full user attribution (AADEmail populated).
//
// This is a DOWNSTREAM signal — it only fires when RunAdvancedHuntingQuery targets
// Sentinel-connected LA tables (SigninLogs, AuditLogs, SecurityAlert, etc.).
// Queries hitting XDR-native tables (DeviceEvents, EmailEvents, etc.) stay in the
// Defender XDR backend and never appear here.
//
// Use alongside Query 7 (MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs) for complete Triage MCP coverage:
//   - Query 7 = PRIMARY: Triage MCP API calls filtered by dedicated AppId 7b7b3966
//   - Query 7b = SUPPLEMENTARY: downstream query execution when AH hits LA tables
//

| order by CallCount desc
```

**Post-processing:** For any rows where `CallerType` = "ServicePrincipal/Agent (App-Only)", cross-reference the `ServicePrincipalId` with Entra via Graph API:

1. **Primary method (most reliable):** Query `/beta/servicePrincipals/{id}?$select=id,appId,displayName,servicePrincipalType,tags` — check `tags` array for agentic indicators:
   - `AgenticApp` — confirms this is an agent application
   - `AIAgentBuilder` — agent was created by an AI agent builder platform
   - `AgentCreatedBy:CopilotStudio` — specifically created by Copilot Studio
   - `AgenticInstance` — runtime instance of an agent
   - `power-virtual-agents-*` — Copilot Studio internal tracking tag
2. **Fallback:** Check `servicePrincipalType` — if it equals `"Agent"`, it is a registered Agent Identity. Note: as of Feb 2026, Copilot Studio agents still show `"Application"` here despite being true agents.
3. **Name-based filtering is UNRELIABLE** — SPNs with "Agent" in display name may be standard app registrations (e.g., "Contoso Agent Tools" = `GitCreatedApp`).

Use `microsoft_graph_suggest_queries` → `microsoft_graph_get` for the Graph API calls. Query multiple SPNs in one call: `/beta/servicePrincipals?$count=true&$filter=id in ('id1','id2')&$select=id,appId,displayName,servicePrincipalType,tags`.

### Query 18: Agent Identity Sign-In Events

```kql
// Agent Identity sign-ins — look for Copilot Studio agent SPNs
// Field-tested: Copilot Studio agents sign in to "Bot Framework" from Azure internal IPv6 (fd00:34f2:*)
// Also check for Graph, Sentinel resources in case agents expand scope
// Cross-reference ServicePrincipalId values from Query 19 AuditLogs results
// Substitute <AGENT_SPN_IDS> with confirmed agent SPN IDs (or remove filter for broad discovery)
AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
// Uncomment the next line if you have confirmed agent SPN IDs from Query 19 / Graph API:
// | where ServicePrincipalId in (<AGENT_SPN_IDS>)
| where ResourceDisplayName has_any ("Graph", "Sentinel", "Microsoft Graph", "Bot Framework")
| summarize
    SignInCount = count(),
    SuccessCount = countif(ResultType == "0" or ResultType == 0),
    FailCount = countif(ResultType != "0" and ResultType != 0),
    DistinctResources = dcount(ResourceDisplayName),
    Resources = make_set(ResourceDisplayName, 10),

    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by ServicePrincipalName, ServicePrincipalId, AppId
| order by SignInCount desc
```

**Telemetry patterns for Copilot Studio agents (field-tested):**
- **Resource:** `Bot Framework` (NOT `Microsoft Graph` — agents talk to Bot Framework runtime)
- **IP addresses:** Azure internal IPv6 (`fd00:34f2:*`) — these are Azure infrastructure IPs, not user IPs
- **Sign-in volume:** Low (single-digit sign-ins typical for idle agents)
- **Correlation:** Match `ServicePrincipalId` here with `TargetId` from Query 19 AuditLogs to confirm the same agent

### Query 19: Agent Identity CRUD Operations in AuditLogs

```kql
// Track creation, modification, and deletion of Agent Identities
// These operations indicate agent lifecycle management in the tenant
// Key insight: Copilot Studio agents are created by "Power Virtual Agents Service"
// and have display names like "Agent (Microsoft Copilot Studio)" or "<Name> (Microsoft Copilot Studio)"

    InitiatedBy == "Power Virtual Agents Service"
    or TargetName has "Copilot Studio"
    or TargetName has "AgenticApp", true, false)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| take 50
```

**Interpreting results:**
- `InitiatedBy` = `Power Virtual Agents Service` → Copilot Studio created/modified this agent SPN automatically
- `InitiatedBy` = `user@domain.com` → Human manually created/modified this SPN (may or may not be an agent)
- `OperationName` = `Hard delete service principal` shortly after `Add service principal` → Testing/experimentation pattern
- Multiple operations (`Add SPN` → `Add owner` → `Update SPN`) within seconds → Copilot Studio automated provisioning sequence

**Post-processing for Query 24:**
- **MCP Server-Driven** rows represent tool calls via the Sentinel Data Lake MCP (GitHub Copilot → MCP Server → Data Lake)
- **Direct KQL** rows represent queries executed via Sentinel Graph / Data Lake Explorer (human or service principal → KQL query → Data Lake)
- Combine this with Query 14 (Analytics tier) for a **complete two-tier governance view**:

| Tier | Data Source | MCP Sources | Non-MCP Sources |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Analytics Tier** | `LAQueryLogs` | AH backend `fc780465` / `M365D_AdvancedHunting` *(captures AH queries from Triage MCP, Defender portal, Security Copilot that hit connected LA tables; shared surface, see Query 7b)* | Sentinel Portal (`80ccca67`), Sentinel Engine analytics (`fc780465`, non-AH), Logic Apps (`de8c33bb`) |
| **Data Lake Tier** | `CloudAppEvents` | Data Lake MCP (RecordType 403, `IMcpToolTemplate`) | Direct KQL (RecordType 379, `KqsService`) |
| **Graph API** | `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` | Graph MCP (`e8c77dc2`) | — |
| **Azure MCP** | `SigninLogs`, `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs`, `LAQueryLogs` | Azure MCP Server (`04b07795`, empty `RequestClientApp`, query text `\n| limit N` suffix) | Azure CLI (same AppId, same empty `RequestClientApp`) |

### Query 25: Azure MCP Server — Authentication Events (SigninLogs)

**⚠️ Pitfall-aware:** Uses `parse_json(Status)`/`parse_json(DeviceDetail)` wrappers — see [SigninLogs Status Field Needs parse_json()](#signinlogs-status-field-needs-parse_json-in-data-lake). Uses `extend SignInType` to avoid `Type` pseudo-column — see [Type Column Unavailable in Data Lake Union Contexts](#type-column-unavailable-in-data-lake-union-contexts).

```kql
// Detect Azure MCP Server authentication events via Azure CLI AppId.
//
// 🔄 UPDATED Feb 2026: Azure MCP Server now uses Azure CLI credential (04b07795),
// NOT AzurePowerShellCredential (1950a258) as previously documented.
// The old AppId 1950a258 + UserAgent 'azsdk-net-Identity' fingerprint is OBSOLETE.
//
// ⚠️ SHARED APPID: 04b07795 is the Azure CLI AppId — shared with manual 'az' CLI usage.
// There is NO unique sign-in fingerprint for Azure MCP Server vs manual Azure CLI.
// This query returns ALL Azure CLI sign-ins. Correlate with LAQueryLogs (Query 26)
// for query-level attribution via the '\n| limit N' text pattern.
//
// NOTE: Sign-in events represent TOKEN ACQUISITIONS, not individual API calls.
// A cached token serves many Azure MCP calls with no additional sign-in events.
// FIX (Feb 2026): Explicit tostring() casts on ResultType, ResultDescription,
// ConditionalAccessStatus, AuthenticationRequirement to prevent union type mismatches
// between SigninLogs and AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs. Removed ResourceId (inconsistent
// across tables). Use parse_json() wrapper on DeviceDetail and LocationDetails — these
// columns may be stored as string (not dynamic) in Data Lake workspaces, causing
// SemanticError on dot-notation access without parse_json().
let azure_mcp_appid = "04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46";
let signinlogs_interactive = SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(90d)
| where AppId == azure_mcp_appid
| extend SignInType = "Interactive"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, AppId,
    ResourceDisplayName, IPAddress, 
    ResultType = tostring(ResultType),
    ResultDescription = tostring(ResultDescription),
    UserAgent, SignInType,
    ConditionalAccessStatus = tostring(ConditionalAccessStatus),
    AuthenticationRequirement = tostring(AuthenticationRequirement),
    OS = tostring(parse_json(DeviceDetail).operatingSystem),
    Country = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).countryOrRegion);
let signinlogs_noninteractive = AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(90d)

    OS = tostring(parse_json(DeviceDetail).operatingSystem),
    Country = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).countryOrRegion);
union signinlogs_interactive, signinlogs_noninteractive
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 26: Azure MCP Server — Workspace Queries (LAQueryLogs)

```kql
// Detect Azure MCP Server workspace queries via LAQueryLogs.
//
// 🔄 UPDATED Feb 2026: Azure MCP Server now uses Azure CLI credential (04b07795).
// RequestClientApp is EMPTY (not 'csharpsdk,LogAnalyticsPSClient' as previously documented).
//
// ⚠️ SHARED FINGERPRINT: Empty RequestClientApp + AppId 04b07795 is shared with manual
// Azure CLI and 4+ other AADClientIds. This query returns ALL queries from AppId 04b07795
// with empty RequestClientApp. To isolate Azure MCP Server queries, look for the
// '\n| limit N' suffix that monitor_workspace_log_query always appends to query text.
//
// 30-day pattern analysis (Feb 2026) showed 11 distinct RequestClientApp values:
//   - Empty ("") = 417 queries across 5 AADClientIds (Azure MCP, Sentinel DL MCP, Portal, etc.)
//   - "csharpsdk,LogAnalyticsPSClient" = only 1 query ever (obsolete fingerprint)
//   - "M365D_AdvancedHunting" = Advanced Hunting backend
//   - "ASI_Portal" / "ASI_Portal_Connectors" = Sentinel Portal
//   - Others: AppInsightsPortalExtension, LogicApps, PSClient, etc.
let azure_cli_appid = "04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46";
LAQueryLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(90d)
| where AADClientId == azure_cli_appid
| extend HasLimitSuffix = QueryText has "\n| limit" or QueryText has "\r\n| limit"
| project TimeGenerated, AADEmail, AADClientId,
    RequestClientApp,
    QueryTextTruncated = substring(QueryText, 0, 300),
    ResponseCode, ResponseRowCount,
    StatsCPUTimeMs,
    RequestTarget,
    HasLimitSuffix
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

> **Post-processing:** Rows with `HasLimitSuffix = true` are highly likely Azure MCP Server queries (the `monitor_workspace_log_query` command always appends `| limit N`). Rows without the suffix may be manual Azure CLI or other tools using the same credential.

### Query 27: Azure MCP Server — AzureActivity Claims Correlation

**⚠️ Pitfall-aware:** Uses `parse_json(Claims)` to extract `appid` — AzureActivity Claims is a JSON string. Only ARM write/action/delete operations appear (reads not logged). See [Azure MCP Server Detection](#azure-mcp-server-detection--updated-feb-2026).

```kql
// Check AzureActivity for Azure MCP Server write operations (read ops not logged)
// Parse Claims.appid to identify the source application
// 🔄 UPDATED Feb 2026: Now uses Azure CLI AppId 04b07795 (previously 1950a258)
AzureActivity
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(90d)
| where CategoryValue == "Administrative"
| extend ClaimsData = parse_json(Claims)
| extend ClaimsAppId = tostring(ClaimsData.appid)
| where ClaimsAppId == "04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46"
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, CallerIpAddress,
    OperationNameValue, ResourceProviderValue,
    ActivityStatusValue, ClaimsAppId,
    ResourceGroup
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

## Proactive Alerting — KQL Data Lake Jobs

This skill provides **on-demand visibility** (Phases 1-7 above). For **continuous, scheduled anomaly detection** that feeds Sentinel analytics rules, use the companion KQL Data Lake Jobs defined in:

📄 **`queries/identity/mcp_anomaly_detection_kql_jobs.md`**

### Maturity Model

| Tier | Capability | Implementation |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **1. Visibility** (current skill) | On-demand MCP usage reports via Copilot chat | This SKILL.md — Phases 1-7, Queries 1-27 |
| **2. Baselining** | 14-day behavioral baselines per user per MCP server | KQL Jobs 1-8 build baselines automatically |
| **3. Alerting** | Automated anomaly detection → Sentinel incidents | KQL Jobs promote to `_KQL_CL` tables → Analytics Rules fire |
| **4. Enforcement** | Real-time guardrails, scope limits (future) | Not yet available — requires MCP protocol-level controls |

### KQL Job Inventory

| Job | Anomaly Type | Source Table(s) | Destination Table | Schedule |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **1** | New sensitive Graph endpoint | `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` | `MCPGraphAnomalies_KQL_CL` | Daily |
| **2** | Graph MCP volume spike (3x baseline) | `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` | `MCPGraphAnomalies_KQL_CL` | Daily |
| **3** | Off-hours Graph MCP activity | `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` | `MCPGraphAnomalies_KQL_CL` | Daily |
| **4** | Graph MCP error rate anomaly | `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` | `MCPGraphAnomalies_KQL_CL` | Daily |
| **5** | New Azure MCP Server user | `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` | `MCPAzureAnomalies_KQL_CL` | Daily |
| **6** | New Azure MCP resource target | `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` | `MCPAzureAnomalies_KQL_CL` | Daily |
| **7** | Sentinel workspace query anomalies | `LAQueryLogs` | `MCPSentinelAnomalies_KQL_CL` | Daily |
| **8** | Cross-MCP activity chains | Multiple (join) | `MCPCrossMCPCorrelation_KQL_CL` | Daily |

### Why KQL Jobs (Not Summary Rules)

KQL jobs support **multi-table joins** — critical for Job 7 (LAQueryLogs + baseline) and Job 8 (Graph + Azure + Sentinel cross-correlation). Summary rules are limited to single-table with `lookup()` joins to analytics-tier tables only.

### Architecture

```
Data Lake ──[KQL Jobs (daily)]──► _KQL_CL tables (analytics tier) ──[Analytics Rules]──► Incidents
```

Key design constraints:
- **15-minute delay**: All queries use `now() - 15m` to account for Data Lake ingestion latency
- **Anomaly-only promotion**: Only flagged records are written to analytics tier (cost optimization)
- **Separate timestamp**: `DetectedTime` preserves original event time; `TimeGenerated` reflects job execution time
- **3 concurrent job limit**: Per tenant — prioritize Jobs 1, 7, 8 for highest-value detections

For full query definitions, deployment checklist, and companion analytics rule templates, see `queries/identity/mcp_anomaly_detection_kql_jobs.md`.

## Known Pitfalls

### Agent Identity vs Standard SPN Ambiguity
**Problem:** `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` does NOT yet distinguish Agent Identities from standard SPNs. Both appear in the `ServicePrincipalId` field with no subtype indicator. Agent Users appear in `UserId` indistinguishably from human users. Additionally, `servicePrincipalType` still returns `"Application"` even for confirmed Copilot Studio agents — the `"Agent"` subtype is not yet populated (as of Feb 2026). This is a [documented known limitation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/agent-id/identity-platform/preview-known-issues#monitoring-and-logs) of the Entra Agent ID preview.  
**Solution (Field-Tested):** Use the **`/beta` `tags` property** as the primary detection method. Query: `GET /beta/servicePrincipals/{id}?$select=id,appId,displayName,servicePrincipalType,tags`. Confirmed Copilot Studio agents will have tags including `AgenticApp`, `AIAgentBuilder`, `AgentCreatedBy:CopilotStudio`, and `AgenticInstance`. Standard app registrations (even those with "Agent" in the display name) will NOT have these tags — they may have tags like `GitCreatedApp` or `disableLegacyUserImpersonation*` instead. For `UserId` values, check against the tenant's agent user inventory. If no Agent Identities exist in the tenant, note this and skip agent-specific analysis.

### Agent Display Name Unreliable for Classification
**Problem:** An SPN with "Agent" in its display name is NOT necessarily an Agent Identity. Example from live testing: "Contoso Agent Tools" is a standard app registration (`servicePrincipalType: Application`, tags: `GitCreatedApp`) — NOT a Copilot Studio agent despite the name. Conversely, a generic name like "Agent (Microsoft Copilot Studio)" IS a real agent.  
**Solution:** NEVER classify SPNs as agents based on display name alone. Always check the `/beta` `tags` array for agentic indicators (`AgenticApp`, `AgentCreatedBy:CopilotStudio`). In AuditLogs, check `InitiatedBy` — agents created by `Power Virtual Agents Service` are Copilot Studio agents, while those created by a `user@domain.com` are manual app registrations.

### Azure MCP Server Detection (🔄 Updated Feb 2026)
**Problem:** Azure MCP Server uses `DefaultAzureCredential` and the credential chain now resolves to **Azure CLI** (AppId `04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46`), NOT `AzurePowerShellCredential` (`1950a258`) as previously documented. In LAQueryLogs, `RequestClientApp` is **empty** (not `csharpsdk,LogAnalyticsPSClient`). The previously documented fingerprint (`1950a258` + `csharpsdk,LogAnalyticsPSClient`) appeared only once in 30-day lookback and is obsolete. ARM read operations (the majority of MCP calls) do not appear in `AzureActivity`.

**Previous fingerprint (OBSOLETE):**
- ❌ AppId `1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2` (AzurePowerShellCredential)
- ❌ `RequestClientApp = "csharpsdk,LogAnalyticsPSClient"` in LAQueryLogs
- ❌ UserAgent `azsdk-net-Identity` as primary differentiator (shared by many Azure SDK services)

**Current fingerprint (field-tested Feb 2026):**
- ✅ AppId `04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46` (Azure CLI)
- ✅ `RequestClientApp` is **empty** (shared with Azure CLI and 4+ other AADClientIds — not a unique fingerprint)
- ✅ Azure MCP `monitor_workspace_log_query` appends `\n| limit N` to query text — **best query-level differentiator**
- ✅ Token caching: sign-in events represent access sessions, not individual API calls

**Solution:** Azure MCP Server queries can be identified in LAQueryLogs with moderate confidence by filtering for AADClientId `04b07795` + query text containing `\n| limit` (the suffix added by `monitor_workspace_log_query`). In SigninLogs, the shared AppId means Azure MCP is indistinguishable from manual Azure CLI usage — present as "Azure MCP Server / Azure CLI (shared AppId `04b07795`)" in reports. The empty `RequestClientApp` bucket contains queries from 5+ different tools, so this field cannot be used for attribution.

**Limitations:**
- ARM read operations produce sign-in events but NOT AzureActivity records
- If the user also runs `az` CLI manually, sign-in events from both are indistinguishable
- The `\n| limit N` query text suffix is the only reliable query-level differentiator but is heuristic
- The credential chain may change with Azure MCP Server updates — monitor for AppId shifts
- AzureActivity has ~2-4h ingestion lag; SigninLogs ~1-2h; LAQueryLogs/AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs ~5-15 min

### MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs Availability
**Problem:** Graph activity logs are NOT enabled by default. If the table is empty or doesn't exist, Graph MCP analysis cannot proceed.  
**Solution:** If `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` returns 0 results or table-not-found error, report: "⚠️ Microsoft Graph activity logs are not enabled in this tenant. Enable them at: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/microsoft-graph-activity-logs-overview". Skip Graph MCP analysis gracefully and proceed with other MCP channels.

### LAQueryLogs Diagnostic Settings
**Problem:** `LAQueryLogs` requires diagnostic settings to be configured on the Log Analytics workspace. Without it, workspace query governance analysis is impossible.  
**Solution:** If `LAQueryLogs` returns empty, report: "⚠️ LAQueryLogs not available — enable Log Analytics workspace diagnostic settings to monitor query activity." Skip workspace governance analysis and note the gap.

### AppId Misclassification History (Field-Tested Feb 2026)

**`80ccca67`** — Previously assumed to be a Graph MCP variant. Actually the **M365 Security & Compliance Center** (Sentinel Portal backend, `RequestClientApp` = `ASI_Portal`). Categorize as "Sentinel Portal (Non-MCP)". Graph MCP has only ONE AppId: `e8c77dc2`.

**`95a5d94c`** — Previously assumed to be "VS Code Copilot" (MCP Client). Actually the **Azure Portal — AppInsightsPortalExtension** blade, executing Usage dashboard/workbook queries in the browser. No SPN or app registration in tenant; not in merill/microsoft-info known apps list. Categorize as "Portal/Platform (Non-MCP)".

> 📘 **Takeaway:** When encountering an unknown AppId in `LAQueryLogs`, check the `RequestClientApp` field first — it reliably reveals the actual source (e.g., `AppInsightsPortalExtension`, `ASI_Portal`). Do not assume an AppId is MCP-related without verifying via Graph API SPN lookup, sign-in logs, and query content analysis.

### CloudAppEvents CamelCase Matching (`ActionType` AND `Operation`)
**Problem:** Both `ActionType` and `RawEventData.Operation` values in `CloudAppEvents` for Sentinel operations use CamelCase without word boundaries (e.g., `SentinelAIToolRunCompleted`, `KQLQueryCompleted`). The `has` operator requires word boundaries and will **NOT** match these values. **Field-tested Feb 2026:** `has "Completed"` returns `false` for ALL Operation values including `KQLQueryCompleted` — the `has` operator fails on substrings within CamelCase tokens.  
**Solution:** Always use `contains` (not `has`) when filtering `ActionType` or `Operation` for Sentinel/KQL operations:
```kql
// ✅ CORRECT — 'contains' works with CamelCase
| where ActionType contains "Sentinel" or ActionType contains "KQL"
| where Operation contains "Completed"

// ❌ WRONG — 'has' requires word boundaries, fails on CamelCase
| where ActionType has "Sentinel" or ActionType has "KQL"
| where Operation has "Completed"  // Returns 0 rows — silently drops ALL MCP events!
```
**Impact if missed:** Query 20 (MCP vs Direct KQL delineation) will show 0 MCP events and ONLY Direct KQL — because MCP events (RecordType 403) are filtered out by `Operation has "Completed"`, while Direct KQL events (RecordType 379) survive via the `OR RecordType == 379` fallback. This creates a false impression that no MCP-driven queries exist.

### CloudAppEvents RawEventData Parsing
**Problem:** `RawEventData` in `CloudAppEvents` is a dynamic column but often contains nested JSON that requires double-parsing. Direct property access (e.g., `RawEventData.ToolName`) may return empty.  
**Solution:** Always parse explicitly with `parse_json(tostring(RawEventData))`:
```kql
| extend RawData = parse_json(tostring(RawEventData))
| extend ToolName = tostring(RawData.ToolName)
```

### Data Lake MCP Has No AppId
**Problem:** Unlike Graph MCP (`e8c77dc2`) and Sentinel Triage MCP (`7b7b3966`), the Sentinel Data Lake MCP has **no dedicated AppId** in any telemetry table. It is not visible in `LAQueryLogs`, `SigninLogs`, or `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`.  
**Solution:** Data Lake MCP activity is audited exclusively via `CloudAppEvents` (Purview unified audit log). Filter by `ActionType contains "SentinelAITool"` (preferred — top-level column) or extract `RecordType` from `RawEventData` with `toint(parse_json(tostring(RawEventData)).RecordType) == 403` and `Interface == "IMcpToolTemplate"`. Note: `RecordType` is NOT a top-level column in `CloudAppEvents` — it is nested inside `RawEventData` and must be extracted via `parse_json()`.

**Table availability (field-tested Feb 2026):** `CloudAppEvents` was confirmed available on **both** Data Lake (`TimeGenerated`, 90d retention) and Advanced Hunting (`Timestamp`, 30d retention) in a standard Sentinel workspace without explicit Purview/E5 configuration. **Always attempt the query first** — only report a gap if the table returns 0 results or a table-not-found error. Do not skip Phase 3 based on licensing assumptions.

### CloudAppEvents Double-Counting Prevention
**Problem:** Each Data Lake MCP tool call generates TWO events: `SentinelAIToolRunStarted` (RecordType 403) and `SentinelAIToolRunCompleted` (RecordType 403). Counting both will double the actual call count.  
**Solution:** Always filter on `Operation == "SentinelAIToolRunCompleted"` for call counts, duration analysis, and error analysis. Use `SentinelAIToolRunStarted` only when investigating specific timing sequences or queue behavior.

### Data Lake MCP ExecutionDuration Format
**Problem:** The `ExecutionDuration` field in `RawEventData` is stored as a **string** (e.g., `"2.4731712"`), not a numeric type. Aggregation functions (`avg`, `max`) will fail without conversion.  
**Solution:** Use `todouble(RawData.ExecutionDuration)` to convert before aggregation.

### Sentinel Engine False Association
**Problem:** The Sentinel analytics engine (`fc780465-2017-40d4-a0c5-307022471b92`) generates the highest query volume in most workspaces but is NOT an MCP server. Including it in MCP totals would massively inflate the numbers.  
**Solution:** ALWAYS label Sentinel Engine and Logic Apps Connector as "Platform (Non-MCP)" in reports. The MCP proportion calculation MUST exclude these from the MCP numerator.

### SigninLogs `Status` Field Needs `parse_json()` in Data Lake
**Problem:** The `Status` column in `SigninLogs` / `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` is a dynamic field containing `{errorCode, failureReason, additionalDetails}`, but Data Lake workspaces may store it as a **string**. Using dot-notation (`Status.errorCode`) without `parse_json()` causes parser errors (`Expected: ;`) or SemanticErrors.  
**Solution:** Always use `tostring(parse_json(Status).errorCode)` — same pattern as `DeviceDetail`, `LocationDetails`, and `ConditionalAccessPolicies`. This works regardless of whether the column is stored as dynamic or string. Query 5 was fixed for this in Feb 2026.

### `Type` Column Unavailable in Data Lake Union Contexts
**Problem:** The `Type` pseudo-column (table name) is **NOT resolvable** in `union` queries executed via Sentinel Data Lake. Using `summarize by Type` in a `union SigninLogs, AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` query fails with `SemanticError: Failed to resolve scalar expression named 'Type'`.  
**Solution:** When you need to distinguish source tables in a union, add `| extend TableName = "SigninLogs"` (or `"AADNonInteractive"`) within each union leg before the union operator. Then `summarize by TableName`. This is already handled in Query 25 via the `SignInType` field pattern (`extend SignInType = "Interactive"` / `"Non-Interactive"`), but ad-hoc summary variants must use the `extend` approach — never `Type`.

### Non-Interactive Sign-In Noise
**Problem:** `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` may contain Logic Apps connector activity (`de8c33bb`) that looks like user activity but is automated.  
**Solution:** When reporting Sentinel MCP auth events from SigninLogs, distinguish interactive (user-initiated) from non-interactive (automated) sources. The LogicApps connector is NOT MCP — exclude it from MCP auth counts.

### Off-Hours Timezone Uncertainty
**Problem:** `TimeGenerated` is always UTC, but "off-hours" has different meaning depending on the user's timezone. A UTC 06:00 call might be 22:00 local or 14:00 local.  
**Solution:** Default to UTC for off-hours calculation. If the user's timezone is known from sign-in data (`LocationDetails`), adjust. Always state the timezone assumption in the report.

### Multi-Tenant Token Confusion
**Problem:** Azure MCP Server uses `DefaultAzureCredential` and may authenticate against the wrong tenant if multiple credentials are cached, causing queries to fail or return data from an unexpected tenant.  
**Solution:** Read `config.json` for the `azure_mcp.tenant` parameter. When making Azure MCP Server calls, always pass the `tenant` parameter explicitly. Note this risk in the report.

### Agent User UPNs Masquerading as Human Users
**Problem:** Agent Users are assigned UPNs and appear in `UserId` fields identically to human users. Without checking the account type, an agent user's MCP activity would be reported as human activity.  
**Solution:** When the MCP Usage Score flags unexpected user diversity or new users (Query 12), cross-reference the `UserId` with Entra to check if the user object is an Agent User (`userType` and account metadata). Agent Users created by Copilot Studio or Agent Identity Blueprints will have specific metadata distinguishing them from workforce accounts.

### Rate Limiting Not Visible in Logs
**Problem:** Graph MCP Server is capped at 100 calls/min/user. If throttled, calls may not appear in logs (no log entry = no visibility).  
**Solution:** If daily call counts show sudden drops to 0 after a high-volume period, note possible throttling. Check for `429 Too Many Requests` response codes in Query 1 raw data.

### SentinelAudit Table Availability
**Problem:** `SentinelAudit` requires Sentinel auditing and health monitoring to be enabled. It may not exist in all workspaces.  
**Solution:** If `SentinelAudit` returns table-not-found, skip Query 15 gracefully. Report: "⚠️ Sentinel auditing not enabled — cannot check configuration changes."

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` table not found | Graph activity logs not enabled. Report gap, skip Graph MCP analysis, provide enablement link. |
| `LAQueryLogs` table not found | Diagnostic settings not configured on LA workspace. Report gap, skip governance analysis. |
| `SentinelAudit` table not found | Sentinel health monitoring not enabled. Report gap, skip config change analysis. |
| `AzureActivity` returns 0 results | No ARM operations in the time range, or no administrative actions by the specified user. |
| Agent Identity query returns empty | Entra Agent ID not enabled or no agents registered. Report gap as "✅ No Agent Identities detected", skip Queries 18-19. |
| `AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs` missing agent subtype | Agent ID preview may not be active. Agent SPNs will appear as regular SPNs. Note limitation. |
| SPN `servicePrincipalType` shows `Application` for known agents | Expected behavior as of Feb 2026. Copilot Studio agents still report as `Application`. Use `/beta` `tags` array instead (`AgenticApp`, `AgentCreatedBy:CopilotStudio`). |
| Agent sign-ins show Azure internal IPv6 (`fd00:*`) | Expected for Copilot Studio agents — they authenticate from Azure infrastructure. Not a concern. |
| Agent SPN hard-deleted shortly after creation | Testing/experimentation pattern. AuditLogs show `Add service principal` → `Hard delete service principal` within minutes. Report duration and flag if unexpected. |
| SigninLogs returns 0 for Sentinel Platform Services | No one authenticated to Sentinel MCP in the time range. Report as "✅ No Sentinel MCP authentication events detected." |
| `CloudAppEvents` table not found | Purview unified audit not available (requires E5 license). Report gap: "⚠️ CloudAppEvents not available — cannot monitor Data Lake MCP usage. Requires Microsoft 365 E5 or Purview audit." Skip Phase 3 (Data Lake MCP). |
| CloudAppEvents returns 0 for Sentinel operations | No Data Lake MCP or Direct KQL activity in the time range. Report as "✅ No Sentinel Data Lake activity detected in CloudAppEvents." |
| `ActionType has "Sentinel"` returns 0 but data exists | CamelCase bug — use `contains` instead of `has` for ActionType matching. See Known Pitfalls. |
| `Operation has "Completed"` drops MCP events silently | Same CamelCase bug — `has "Completed"` returns false for ALL CamelCase operations (`SentinelAIToolRunCompleted`, `KQLQueryCompleted`). MCP events (RecordType 403) are silently dropped; Direct KQL survives only via `OR RecordType == 379` fallback. Use `contains "Completed"`. See Known Pitfalls. |
| `RawEventData.ToolName` returns empty | Double-parse required: use `parse_json(tostring(RawEventData))` then extract fields. See Known Pitfalls. |
| Query timeout | Reduce lookback from 30d to 7d, or add `| take 100` to intermediate results. |
| Unknown AppId in LAQueryLogs | Cross-reference with Entra ID > App Registrations. May be a custom MCP server or third-party tool. |
| Multiple workspaces available | Follow workspace selection rules — STOP, list all, ASK user, WAIT. |
| Azure MCP calls indistinguishable from CLI | Partially resolved: AppId `04b07795` is shared with Azure CLI. Use `\n| limit N` query text pattern in LAQueryLogs as best differentiator. Present as "Azure MCP / Azure CLI (shared AppId)" in reports. |
