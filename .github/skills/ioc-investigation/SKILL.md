# IoC (Indicator of Compromise) Investigation - Instructions

## Purpose

This skill performs comprehensive security investigations on Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) including:
- **IP Addresses**: Network connections, threat intel matches, geographic analysis, organizational exposure
- **DNS Domains**: Domain reputation, connection events, email-based threats, URL analysis
- **URLs**: URL reputation, phishing detection, email delivery, browser activity
- **File Hashes**: Malware analysis, file prevalence, related alerts, affected devices

The investigation correlates IoCs with Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence, identifies associated CVEs, and enumerates organizational assets affected by those vulnerabilities.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️

**Before starting ANY IoC investigation:**

1. **ALWAYS identify the IoC type FIRST** (IP, Domain, URL, or File Hash)
2. **ALWAYS normalize the IoC** (lowercase domains, validate IP format, extract domain from URL)
3. **ALWAYS calculate date ranges correctly** (use current date from context - see Date Range section)
4. **ALWAYS track and report time after each major step** (mandatory)
5. **ALWAYS run independent queries in parallel** (drastically faster execution)
6. **ALWAYS use `create_file` for JSON export** (NEVER use PowerShell terminal commands)
7. **⛔ ALWAYS enforce Sentinel workspace selection** (see Workspace Selection section below)

---

## ⛔ MANDATORY: Sentinel Workspace Selection

**This skill requires a Sentinel workspace to execute queries. Follow these rules STRICTLY:**

### When invoked from incident-investigation skill:
- Inherit the workspace selection from the parent investigation context
- If no workspace was selected in parent context: **STOP and ask user to select**
- Use the `SELECTED_WORKSPACE_IDS` passed from the parent skill

### When invoked standalone (direct user request):
1. **ALWAYS call `list_sentinel_workspaces` MCP tool FIRST**
2. **If 1 workspace exists:** Auto-select, display to user, proceed
3. **If multiple workspaces exist:**
   - Display all workspaces with Name and ID
   - ASK: "Which Sentinel workspace should I use for this investigation?"
   - **⛔ STOP AND WAIT** for user response
   - **⛔ DO NOT proceed until user explicitly selects**
4. **If a query fails on the selected workspace:**
   - **⛔ DO NOT automatically try another workspace**
   - STOP and report the error
   - Display available workspaces
   - ASK user to select a different workspace
   - WAIT for user response

### Workspace Failure Handling

```
IF query returns "Failed to resolve table" or similar error:
    - STOP IMMEDIATELY
    - Report: "⚠️ Query failed on workspace [NAME] ([ID]). Error: [ERROR_MESSAGE]"
    - Display: "Available workspaces: [LIST_ALL_WORKSPACES]"
    - ASK: "Which workspace should I use instead?"
    - WAIT for explicit user response
    - DO NOT retry with a different workspace automatically
```

**🔴 PROHIBITED ACTIONS:**
- ❌ Selecting a workspace without user consent when multiple exist
- ❌ Switching to another workspace after a failure without asking
- ❌ Proceeding with investigation if workspace selection is ambiguous
- ❌ Assuming a workspace based on previous sessions

---

**IoC Type Detection Rules:**
| Pattern | IoC Type | Normalization |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| `\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}` | IPv4 Address | Validate octets ≤255 |
| `[a-fA-F0-9:]+` (with multiple colons) | IPv6 Address | Lowercase, expand if needed |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}` | Domain | Lowercase, remove trailing dot |
| `https?://.*` or starts with `www.` | URL | Extract domain for separate analysis |
| 32 hex chars | MD5 Hash | Lowercase |
| 40 hex chars | SHA1 Hash | Lowercase |
| 64 hex chars | SHA256 Hash | Lowercase |

**Date Range Rules:**
- **Real-time/recent searches:** Add +2 days to current date for end range
- **Historical ranges:** Add +1 day to user's specified end date
- **Example:** Current date = Jan 23; "Last 7 days" → `datetime(2026-01-16)` to `datetime(2026-01-25)`

---

## Available Investigation Types

### IP Address Investigation
**When to use:** Suspicious inbound/outbound connections, firewall alerts, sign-in anomalies

**Example prompts:**
- "Investigate IP 203.0.113.42"
- "Is 198.51.100.10 malicious?"
- "Check threat intel for 192.0.2.1"

**Data sources:**
- Defender Threat Intelligence (IP alerts, statistics)
- DeviceNetworkEvents (connection history)
- ThreatIntelIndicators (Sentinel TI table)
- SigninLogs (if used for authentication)
- Defender IOC list (custom indicators)
- **`enrich_ips.py`** (3rd-party enrichment: ipinfo.io geo/ISP, vpnapi.io VPN/proxy/Tor, AbuseIPDB abuse score & reports, Shodan ports/services/CVEs/tags)

### Domain Investigation
**When to use:** Suspicious DNS queries, phishing domains, C2 communication

**Example prompts:**
- "Investigate domain malware-c2.example.com"
- "Is evil.com in our threat intel?"
- "Check if any devices connected to suspicious.net"

**Data sources:**
- DeviceNetworkEvents (DNS queries, HTTP connections)
- EmailUrlInfo (email-delivered URLs)
- ThreatIntelIndicators (domain indicators)
- Defender IOC list (blocked domains)
- UrlClickEvents (user clicks on domain)

### URL Investigation
**When to use:** Phishing links, malicious downloads, suspicious redirects

**Example prompts:**
- "Investigate URL https://phishing.example.com/login"
- "Was this URL clicked by anyone?"
- "Check threat intel for http://malware.site/payload.exe"

**Data sources:**
- EmailUrlInfo (URLs in emails)
- UrlClickEvents (click tracking)
- DeviceNetworkEvents (HTTP/HTTPS connections)
- DeviceFileEvents (downloads from URL)
- ThreatIntelIndicators (URL patterns)

### File Hash Investigation
**When to use:** Malware analysis, suspicious executables, file reputation

**Example prompts:**
- "Investigate hash a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
- "Is this SHA256 known malware?"
- "Which devices have this file?"

**Data sources:**
- Defender File Info & Statistics
- Defender File Alerts
- Defender File Related Machines
- DeviceFileEvents (file creation/modification)
- ThreatIntelIndicators (file hash indicators)

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

When a user requests an IoC investigation:

1. **Identify & Normalize IoC:**
   ```
   - Detect IoC type (IP/Domain/URL/Hash)
   - Normalize format (lowercase, validate)
   - Extract embedded IoCs (domain from URL)
   ```

2. **Run Parallel Queries (Batch 1 - Threat Intel):**
   - Sentinel ThreatIntelIndicators query
   - Defender Indicators lookup (ListDefenderIndicators)
   - Defender IP/File alerts (GetDefenderIpAlerts or GetDefenderFileAlerts)
   - Defender IP/File statistics

3. **Run 3rd-Party IP Enrichment (IP IoCs only):**
   ```powershell
   python enrich_ips.py <IP_ADDRESS>
   ```
   - ipinfo.io: Geolocation, ISP/ASN, hosting provider
   - vpnapi.io: VPN, proxy, Tor exit node detection
   - AbuseIPDB: Abuse confidence score, recent attack reports
   - Shodan: Open ports, services/banners, CVEs, tags (e.g., `c2`, `eol-os`, `self-signed`)

4. **Run Parallel Queries (Batch 2 - Activity):**
   - DeviceNetworkEvents (connections involving IoC)
   - AlertEvidence (alerts with IoC as evidence)
   - SecurityAlert (alerts mentioning IoC)
   - EmailUrlInfo (if domain/URL)

5. **CVE & Vulnerability Correlation:**
   - Extract CVE IDs from threat intel results AND Shodan enrichment
   - For each CVE: ListDefenderMachinesByVulnerability
   - Aggregate affected devices

6. **Export to JSON & Generate Summary:**
   ```
   temp/ioc_investigation_{ioc_normalized}_{timestamp}.json
   ```

---

## Execution Workflow

### 🚨 MANDATORY: Time Tracking Pattern

**YOU MUST TRACK AND REPORT TIME AFTER EVERY MAJOR STEP:**

```
[MM:SS] ✓ Step description (XX seconds)
```

**Required Reporting Points:**
1. After IoC normalization and type detection
2. After 3rd-party IP enrichment (IP IoCs)
3. After Defender/Sentinel threat intelligence lookup
4. After activity/connection analysis
5. After CVE correlation and device enumeration
6. After JSON file creation
7. Final: Total elapsed time

---

### Phase 1: IoC Identification and Normalization (REQUIRED FIRST)

**Step 1.1: Detect IoC Type**
```python
# Regex patterns for IoC detection
IPv4: r'^(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}$'
IPv6: r'^([0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}:){7}[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}$'
Domain: r'^([a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9\-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
URL: r'^https?://'
MD5: r'^[a-fA-F0-9]{32}$'
SHA1: r'^[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$'
SHA256: r'^[a-fA-F0-9]{64}$'
```

**Step 1.2: Normalize IoC**
- **IP Address:** Validate octets, detect IPv4 vs IPv6
- **Domain:** Lowercase, remove trailing dots, extract from URL if needed
- **URL:** Keep full URL, also extract domain for parallel investigation
- **Hash:** Lowercase

**Step 1.3: Create Investigation Context**
```json
{
  "ioc_type": "ip|domain|url|hash",
  "ioc_value": "<normalized_value>",
  "ioc_original": "<user_provided_value>",
  "extracted_domain": "<if_url>",
  "investigation_start": "<timestamp>",
  "date_range_start": "<StartDate>",
  "date_range_end": "<EndDate>"
}
```

---

### Phase 2: 3rd-Party IP Enrichment (IP Address IoCs)

**MANDATORY for all IP address investigations.** Run `enrich_ips.py` to get external threat intelligence context that is NOT available from Defender/Sentinel native tools.

```powershell
python enrich_ips.py <IP_ADDRESS_1> <IP_ADDRESS_2> ...
```

**What it provides:**

| Source | Intelligence |
|--------|--------------|
| **ipinfo.io** | Geolocation (city, country, coordinates), ISP/ASN, organization, hosting provider detection |
| **vpnapi.io** | VPN, proxy, Tor exit node, relay detection |
| **AbuseIPDB** | Abuse confidence score (0-100), total reports, last reported date, recent reporter comments with attack categories |
| **Shodan** | Open ports, service/banner details, OS detection, known CVEs, tags (e.g., `c2`, `eol-os`, `self-signed`, `honeypot`), CPEs, hostnames |

**Output:** Per-IP detailed results printed to terminal + JSON export saved to `temp/`.

**Integration with investigation:**
- **AbuseIPDB score ≥ 75:** 🔴 Strong indicator of malicious activity — flag as high risk
- **VPN/Proxy/Tor detected:** 🟠 Potential evasion — note in risk assessment
- **Shodan tags contain `c2`:** 🔴 Known C2 infrastructure — escalate immediately
- **Shodan CVEs found:** Cross-reference with Phase 5 CVE correlation for organizational exposure
- **Hosting provider (not residential ISP):** 🟡 May indicate attacker infrastructure

> **Note:** For domain and URL IoCs, extract the resolved IP(s) from DeviceNetworkEvents results and run enrichment on those IPs as a follow-up step.

---

### Phase 3: Parallel Threat Intelligence Collection (Defender & Sentinel)

**CRITICAL:** Run ALL threat intel queries in parallel for speed!

#### Batch 1: Threat Intelligence APIs (Run ALL in parallel)

| Query | Tool/API | IoC Types |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Defender IOC List | `ListDefenderIndicators` ⚠️ | IP, Domain, URL |
| Defender IP Alerts | `GetDefenderIpAlerts` | IP |
| Defender IP Statistics | `GetDefenderIpStatistics` | IP |
| Defender File Alerts | `GetDefenderFileAlerts` | Hash |
| Defender File Info | `GetDefenderFileInfo` | Hash |
| Defender File Statistics | `GetDefenderFileStatistics` | Hash |
| Defender File Machines | `GetDefenderFileRelatedMachines` | Hash |

> ⚠️ **ListDefenderIndicators Note:** If result is written to file (>50KB), you MUST read and filter the file manually. See [Custom IOC Management](#custom-ioc-management) for required processing steps.

#### Batch 2: Sentinel KQL Queries (Run ALL in parallel)

| Query | Table | IoC Types |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| TI Indicators Match | ThreatIntelIndicators | All |
| Network Connections | DeviceNetworkEvents | IP, Domain, URL |
| Alert Evidence | AlertEvidence | All |
| Security Alerts | SecurityAlert | All |
| Email URLs | EmailUrlInfo | Domain, URL |

---

### Phase 4: CVE Correlation and Vulnerability Management

**Step 4.1: Extract CVE IDs from Threat Intel AND Enrichment**
- Parse threat intel results for CVE references (pattern: `CVE-\d{4}-\d{4,}`)
- Extract from: alert descriptions, threat family info, MITRE techniques
- **Extract from Shodan enrichment** (`shodan_vulns` field from `enrich_ips.py` output)

**Step 4.2: Query Affected Devices per CVE**
```
For each CVE_ID found:
  → ListDefenderMachinesByVulnerability(cveId: CVE_ID)
  → Collect: deviceId, deviceName, osPlatform, exposureLevel
```

**Step 4.3: Aggregate Device Exposure**
```json
{
  "cve_correlation": {
    "cve_ids_found": ["CVE-2024-1234", "CVE-2024-5678"],
    "affected_devices_by_cve": {
      "CVE-2024-1234": [
        {"deviceId": "...", "deviceName": "...", "osPlatform": "..."}
      ]
    },
    "total_unique_affected_devices": 15,
    "critical_cves": 2,
    "high_cves": 3
  }
}
```

---

### Phase 5: Activity and Connection Analysis

**For IP Address IoCs:**
```kql
let start = datetime(<StartDate>);
let end = datetime(<EndDate>);
let IPAddress = '<IP_ADDRESS>';
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp between (start .. end)
| where RemoteIP == IPAddress or LocalIP == IPAddress
| summarize 
    ConnectionCount = count(),
    UniqueDevices = dcount(DeviceId),
    FirstSeen = min(Timestamp),
    LastSeen = max(Timestamp),
    Ports = make_set(RemotePort),
    Protocols = make_set(Protocol)
    by ActionType
| order by ConnectionCount desc
```

**For Domain IoCs:**
```kql
let start = datetime(<StartDate>);
let end = datetime(<EndDate>);
let Domain = '<DOMAIN>';
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp between (start .. end)
| where RemoteUrl has Domain
| summarize 
    ConnectionCount = count(),
    UniqueDevices = dcount(DeviceId),
    FirstSeen = min(Timestamp),
    LastSeen = max(Timestamp),
    UniqueURLs = make_set(RemoteUrl, 10)
    by DeviceName
| order by ConnectionCount desc
```

**For File Hash IoCs:**
```kql
let start = datetime(<StartDate>);
let end = datetime(<EndDate>);
let Hash = '<HASH>';
union withsource=SourceTable DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents, DeviceFileEvents, DeviceRegistryEvents, DeviceLogonEvents, DeviceImageLoadEvents, DeviceEvents
| where Timestamp between (start .. end)
| where SHA1 =~ Hash or SHA256 =~ Hash or MD5 =~ Hash or InitiatingProcessSHA256 =~ Hash
| summarize 
    EventCount = count(),
    UniqueDevices = dcount(DeviceId),
    FirstSeen = min(Timestamp),
    LastSeen = max(Timestamp),
    FileNames = make_set(FileName),
    FolderPaths = make_set(FolderPath, 5)
    by ActionType
| order by EventCount desc
```

---

### Phase 6: Export to JSON

Create single JSON file: `temp/ioc_investigation_{ioc_type}_{ioc_normalized}_{timestamp}.json`

---

## Sample KQL Queries

Use these exact patterns with appropriate MCP tools. Replace `<IOC_VALUE>`, `<StartDate>`, `<EndDate>`.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Sentinel Data Lake MCP Parameter Names**

When calling Sentinel Data Lake MCP tools, use the **exact parameter name** `workspaceId` (camelCase):

| Tool | Parameter | ✅ Correct | ❌ Wrong |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| `query_lake` | Workspace ID | `workspaceId` | `workspace_id`, `WorkspaceId` |
| `search_tables` | Workspace ID | `workspaceId` | `workspace_id`, `WorkspaceId` |
| `analyze_user_entity` | Workspace ID | `workspaceId` | `workspace_id`, `WorkspaceId` |
| `analyze_url_entity` | Workspace ID | `workspaceId` | `workspace_id`, `WorkspaceId` |

See **copilot-instructions.md → Integration with MCP Servers** for full parameter reference.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: START WITH THESE EXACT QUERY PATTERNS**
**These queries have been tested and validated. Use them as your PRIMARY reference.**

---

### 📅 Date Range Quick Reference

**🔴 STEP 0: GET CURRENT DATE FIRST (MANDATORY) 🔴**
- **ALWAYS check the current date from the context header BEFORE calculating date ranges**
- **NEVER use hardcoded years** - the year changes and you WILL query the wrong timeframe

**RULE 1: Real-Time/Recent Searches (Current Activity)**
- **Add +2 days to current date for end range**
- **Why +2?** +1 for timezone offset + +1 for inclusive end-of-day
- **Pattern**: Today is Jan 23 → Use `datetime(2026-01-25)` as end date

**RULE 2: Historical Searches (User-Specified Dates)**
- **Add +1 day to user's specified end date**
- **Why +1?** To include all 24 hours of the final day

---

### Custom IOC Management

**Search Existing IOCs:**
```
Tool: ListDefenderIndicators (MCP)
Parameters (all optional):
  indicatorType = "IpAddress" | "DomainName" | "Url" | "FileSha1" | "FileSha256" | "FileMd5"
  indicatorValue = "<IOC_VALUE>"
  action = "Alert" | "Block" | "Allow"
  severity = "Informational" | "Low" | "Medium" | "High"
Returns: Matching custom indicators in tenant
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Processing Large ListDefenderIndicators Results**

The `ListDefenderIndicators` API may return ALL custom indicators in the tenant regardless of filter parameters. When results are large (>50KB), they are written to a temporary file instead of returned inline.

**MANDATORY Processing Steps:**
1. **If result says "Large tool result written to file":**
   - Use `read_file` tool to read the content file path provided
   - Parse the JSON response to extract the `value` array
   - **Manually filter** for the target IoC using case-insensitive matching:
     ```python
     # Filter logic for IP address
     matches = [ind for ind in indicators["value"] 
                if ind.get("indicatorValue", "").lower() == target_ioc.lower()]
     ```
   - Report: "Found X custom indicator(s) matching [IOC]" or "No custom indicators match [IOC]"

2. **If result is inline JSON with empty `value` array:**
   - Report: "No custom indicators found for [IOC]"

**🔴 PROHIBITED:**
- ❌ Assuming "large result = no match" without reading and filtering the file
- ❌ Reporting "Not in IOC list" without verifying the actual content
- ❌ Skipping file processing due to result size

**Example - Correct Processing:**
```
1. Call: ListDefenderIndicators(indicatorType: "IpAddress", indicatorValue: "203.0.113.42")
2. Result: "Large tool result (69KB) written to file: /path/to/content.json"
3. Action: read_file(/path/to/content.json)
4. Parse: Extract value array from JSON
5. Filter: Search for indicatorValue == "203.0.113.42" (case-insensitive)
6. Report: "No custom indicators match 203.0.113.42" OR "Found 1 custom indicator: [details]"
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **No TI matches found** | IoC may be unknown; proceed with activity analysis |
| **Defender API returns 404** | IoC not in organization's scope; check Sentinel data |
| **Empty DeviceNetworkEvents** | Expand date range or check if MDE is deployed |
| **CVE not found in vulnerability DB** | CVE may be too new or not applicable to org assets |
| **Multiple IoC types detected** | Investigate each separately, correlate results |
| **Rate limiting on API calls** | Add delays between API calls, batch where possible |
| **ListDefenderIndicators returns large file** | Read file with `read_file`, parse JSON, manually filter for target IoC value |

### Required Field Defaults

If queries return no results, use these defaults:

```json
{
  "threat_intelligence": {
    "sentinel_ti_matches": [],
    "defender_alerts": [],
    "verdict": "Unknown",
    "confidence_score": 0
  },
  "activity_analysis": {
    "network_connections": {
      "total_connections": 0,
      "unique_devices": 0
    }
  },
  "cve_correlation": {
    "cve_ids_found": [],
    "affected_devices_by_cve": {},
    "total_unique_affected_devices": 0
  }
}
```

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: IP Address Investigation

**User says:** "Investigate IP 203.0.113.42 for the last 7 days"

**Workflow:**
1. **Identify IoC:** IPv4 Address, normalized: `203.0.113.42`
2. **3rd-Party Enrichment:**
   ```powershell
   python enrich_ips.py 203.0.113.42
   ```
   → Get geo, ISP, VPN/proxy/Tor flags, AbuseIPDB score, Shodan ports/CVEs/tags
3. **Phase 1 - Threat Intel (parallel):**
   - `GetDefenderIpAlerts(ipAddress: "203.0.113.42")`
   - Sentinel ThreatIntelIndicators query
   - `ListDefenderIndicators(indicatorType: "IpAddress", indicatorValue: "203.0.113.42")`
4. **Phase 2 - Activity Analysis (parallel):**
   - DeviceNetworkEvents query for IP
   - SigninLogs query for IP
   - AlertEvidence query for IP
5. **Phase 3 - CVE Correlation:**
   - Extract CVEs from alerts AND Shodan enrichment
   - For each CVE: `ListDefenderMachinesByVulnerability`
6. **Export JSON and summarize findings** (include enrichment data in JSON export)

### Example 2: Domain Investigation

**User says:** "Is evil-malware.com in our environment?"

**Workflow:**
1. **Identify IoC:** Domain, normalized: `evil-malware.com`
2. **Phase 1 - Threat Intel (parallel):**
   - Sentinel ThreatIntelIndicators query
   - `ListDefenderIndicators(indicatorType: "DomainName", indicatorValue: "evil-malware.com")`
3. **Phase 2 - Activity Analysis (parallel):**
   - DeviceNetworkEvents query for domain
   - EmailUrlInfo query for domain
   - AlertEvidence query for domain
4. **Phase 3 - Exposure Assessment:**
   - List all devices that connected
   - Identify affected users
5. **Export JSON and summarize findings**

### Example 3: File Hash Investigation with CVE Correlation

**User says:** "Investigate SHA256 a1b2c3... and check which devices are vulnerable"

**Workflow:**
1. **Identify IoC:** SHA256 Hash, normalized: `a1b2c3...`
2. **Phase 1 - Threat Intel (parallel):**
   - `GetDefenderFileInfo(fileHash: "a1b2c3...")`
   - `GetDefenderFileAlerts(fileHash: "a1b2c3...")`
   - `GetDefenderFileStatistics(fileHash: "a1b2c3...")`
3. **Phase 2 - Device Exposure:**
   - `GetDefenderFileRelatedMachines(fileHash: "a1b2c3...")`
   - DeviceFileEvents query
4. **Phase 3 - CVE Correlation:**
   - Extract CVEs from file threat family info
   - For each CVE: `ListDefenderMachinesByVulnerability`
   - Cross-reference with devices that have the file
5. **Export JSON and summarize with remediation priorities**

## Security Notes

- All investigations are logged for audit purposes
- IoC values may be sensitive - handle with care
- Follow organizational data classification policies
- Consider threat actor attribution implications
- Document investigation actions for incident timeline

---

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill can be combined with:
- **user-investigation**: When IoC is found in user's sign-in logs
- **computer-investigation**: When IoC is found on specific device
- **authentication-tracing**: When IoC IP appears in auth anomalies
- **ca-policy-investigation**: When IoC triggers conditional access events

**Cross-skill pivot example:**
"Investigate IP 203.0.113.42" → Found in user sign-ins → "Investigate user@domain.com" using user-investigation skill
