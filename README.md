# 🔒 Security Investigation Automation System

**Comprehensive, automated security investigations powered by Microsoft Sentinel, Defender XDR, Graph API, and threat intelligence — with 16 specialized Agent Skills**

An investigation automation framework that combines **GitHub Copilot**, **VS Code Agent Skills**, and **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** to enable natural language security investigations. Ask questions like *"Investigate this user for the last 7 days"* or *"Is this IP malicious?"* and get comprehensive analysis with KQL queries, threat intelligence correlation, and professional reports.

### Quick Start (TL;DR)

```powershell
# 1. Clone and open in VS Code
git clone https://github.com/SCStelz/security-investigator.git
code security-investigator

# 2. Set up Python environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1          # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate          # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure API keys
copy config.json.template config.json
# Edit config.json → add your Sentinel workspace ID, tenant ID, and API tokens

# 4. Configure MCP servers
copy .vscode\mcp.json.template .vscode\mcp.json
# All platform servers are pre-configured — just needs a GitHub PAT on first use

# 5. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I) in Agent mode and ask:
#    "What skills do you have access to?"
#    "Investigate user@domain.com for the last 7 days"
```

### How Skills Work

1. You ask Copilot a question (e.g., "Investigate user@domain.com for the last 7 days")
2. Copilot detects keywords and loads the appropriate skill from `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
3. The skill provides specialized workflow, KQL queries, and risk assessment criteria
4. Universal patterns from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are inherited automatically

### Triggering Skills with Natural Language

You don't need to mention the skill name — keywords are detected automatically:

| What you say | Skill triggered |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Investigate user@domain.com for the last 7 days" | user-investigation |
| "Analyze incident 12345" | incident-investigation |
| "Is this IP malicious? 203.0.113.42" | ioc-investigation |
| "Check the device WORKSTATION-01 for threats" | computer-investigation |
| "Show attack patterns on a heatmap" | heatmap-visualization |
| "Map the geographic origins of these attacks" | geomap-visualization |
| "Write a KQL query to find failed sign-ins" | kql-query-authoring |
| "Trace this authentication back to the original MFA" | authentication-tracing |
| "Detect scope drift in service principals" | scope-drift-detection/spn |
| "Check user behavioral drift for user@domain.com" | scope-drift-detection/user |
| "Analyze device process drift across the fleet" | scope-drift-detection/device |
| "Show me MCP server usage for the last 30 days" | mcp-usage-monitoring |
| "Generate a Sentinel ingestion report for the last 30 days" | sentinel-ingestion-report |

### Follow-ups and Chaining

After running an investigation, ask follow-up questions without re-running the entire workflow:

```
Is that IP a VPN?
Trace authentication for that suspicious location
Was MFA used for those sign-ins?
```

Skills can be chained for comprehensive analysis:

```
1. "Investigate incident 12345" → incident-investigation extracts entities
2. "Now investigate the user from that incident" → user-investigation runs on extracted UPN
3. "Check if that IP is malicious" → ioc-investigation analyzes the suspicious IP
4. "Show me a heatmap of the attack patterns" → heatmap-visualization
```

Copilot uses existing investigation data from `temp/investigation_*.json` when available.

### Discovering Skills

### Authoring New Skills from Investigations

One of the most powerful aspects of this project is that **ad-hoc threat hunting and investigations naturally evolve into reusable skills**. After completing an investigation — chasing a novel attack pattern, triaging an unfamiliar alert type, or building a new KQL query chain — you can ask Copilot to codify that workflow into a new SKILL.md file. This captures the verified queries, schema pitfalls, enrichment steps, and analytical logic so that any SOC analyst on the team can repeat the same high-quality investigation with a single natural-language prompt.

This extends beyond your own investigations. When new threat research drops — a blog post detailing an [AiTM phishing campaign](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/12/from-cookie-theft-to-bec-attackers-use-aitm-phishing-sites-as-entry-point-to-further-financial-fraud/), a write-up on a novel [scope drift detection technique](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftsentinelblog/the-agentic-soc-era-how-sentinel-mcp-enables-autonomous-security-reasoning/4491003), or an emerging ransomware TTP — you can feed the article URL to Copilot and ask it to extract the attacker behaviors, map them to relevant Sentinel tables, build the detection queries, validate them against your environment, and then package the entire workflow as a new skill. What used to be a manual process of reading a threat intel report, translating IOCs and TTPs into KQL, and documenting runbooks becomes a single conversational workflow.

It brings a DevOps mindset to Security Engineering: every investigation and every piece of external threat research becomes an opportunity to improve the shared knowledge base, drive collaboration across the team, and raise the overall quality bar — turning tribal knowledge into version-controlled, peer-reviewable, continuously improving automation.

**Sample prompts for creating a new skill:**

```
Based on the investigation we just completed, create a new reusable skill.
Review the queries we ran, the enrichment steps, and the analytical logic,
then package it all into a SKILL.md file following the existing skill format
in .github/skills/. Include the verified KQL queries, known schema pitfalls,
and a step-by-step workflow that another analyst could follow.
```

```
Read this threat intelligence article: <URL>
Extract the attacker TTPs — initial access, persistence mechanisms, lateral
movement, and exfiltration techniques. Map each TTP to the relevant Sentinel
and Defender tables, write detection queries, and create a new investigation
skill that hunts for these behaviors across our environment.
```

### Query Library (`queries/`)

The `queries/` folder contains **verified, battle-tested KQL query collections** organized by detection scenario. These are the **Priority 2 lookup source** in the [KQL Pre-Flight Checklist](.github/copilot-instructions.md) — Copilot searches them before writing any ad-hoc KQL.

Each file uses a standardized metadata header for efficient `grep_search` discovery:
```markdown
# <Title>
**Tables:** <exact KQL table names>
**Keywords:** <searchable terms — attack techniques, scenarios, field names>
**MITRE:** <ATT&CK technique IDs, e.g., T1021.001, TA0008>
```

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **VS Code** | Version 1.99+ recommended (Agent mode + MCP support). [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) required for MCP Apps (visualization). |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Active subscription — [Copilot Pro+](https://github.com/features/copilot), Business, or Enterprise. Agent mode must be enabled. |
| **Python 3.8+** | For IP enrichment utility and report generation. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **Azure CLI** | Required for Azure MCP Server (underlying auth) and `sentinel-ingestion-report` skill (`az monitor log-analytics query` for all KQL queries, `az rest` for analytic rule inventory, `az monitor log-analytics workspace table list` for tier classification). [Install](https://aka.ms/installazurecli). Authenticate: `az login --tenant <tenant_id>`, then `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`. Requires **Log Analytics Reader** (KQL queries + table list) and **Microsoft Sentinel Reader** (analytic rule inventory) on the workspace. |
| **PowerShell 7.0+** | Required for `sentinel-ingestion-report` skill (parallel query execution via `ForEach-Object -Parallel`). [Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell). Verify: `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`. |
| **Node.js 18+** | Required for KQL Search MCP (`npx`) and building local MCP Apps. [Download](https://nodejs.org/) or install via `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` (Windows) / `brew install node` (macOS). |
| **Microsoft Sentinel** | Log Analytics workspace with data. You'll need the workspace GUID and tenant ID. |

```powershell
python --version   # Requires 3.8+
node --version     # Requires 18+ (needed for KQL Search MCP)
az --version       # Azure CLI (needed for Azure MCP Server, ingestion report skill)
pwsh --version     # Requires 7.0+ (needed for sentinel-ingestion-report skill)
```

If Node.js is missing: [Download](https://nodejs.org/) or run `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` (Windows) / `brew install node` (macOS).
If Azure CLI is missing: [Install](https://aka.ms/installazurecli), then `az login --tenant <tenant_id>` and `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>`.

Set up Python environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy `config.json.template` to `config.json` and fill in your values:

```json
{
  "sentinel_workspace_id": "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID_HERE",
  "tenant_id": "YOUR_TENANT_ID_HERE",
  "subscription_id": "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_HERE",
  "azure_mcp": {
    "resource_group": "YOUR_LOG_ANALYTICS_RESOURCE_GROUP",
    "workspace_name": "YOUR_LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_NAME",
    "tenant": "YOUR_TENANT_ID_HERE",

| `output_dir` | No | Directory for HTML reports (default: `reports`) |

### 3. Configure MCP Servers

Copy the MCP server template (all platform servers + 3 optional MCP Apps are pre-configured):

```powershell
copy .vscode/mcp.json.template .vscode/mcp.json
```

The template includes inline documentation for each server. On first use, VS Code will prompt for:
- **Entra ID login** — browser-based auth for Sentinel Data Lake, Graph, Triage, and Sentinel Graph servers
- **[GitHub PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)** — for KQL Search MCP (schema intelligence and query discovery). Needs `public_repo` scope.

See [MCP Server Setup](#-mcp-server-setup) below for per-server permissions and installation guides.

### 4. Build MCP Apps (Optional — Visualization Skills)

> ⚠️ **VS Code Insiders Required:** MCP Apps currently require [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). Requires **Node.js 18+**.

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-geomap-server; npm install; npm run build; cd ../..
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-heatmap-server; npm install; npm run build; cd ../..
cd mcp-apps/sentinel-incident-comment; npm install; npm run build; cd ../..
```

**Bash (macOS/Linux):**
```bash

## 🔌 MCP Server Setup

The system uses several Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. All are **pre-configured** in [.vscode/mcp.json.template](.vscode/mcp.json.template) — copy it to `.vscode/mcp.json` to get started (see [Step 3 above](#3-configure-mcp-servers)). The sections below document permissions, tools, and installation guides for each server.

### 1. Microsoft Sentinel MCP Server

**📖 [Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/developer/mcp-get-started)**

**Tools:** `query_lake`, `search_tables`, `list_sentinel_workspaces`

**Permissions:**
- **Log Analytics Reader** (minimum) — query workspace data
- **Sentinel Reader** (recommended) — full investigation capabilities
- **Sentinel Contributor** — watchlist management (optional)

### 2. MCP Server for Microsoft Graph

**📖 [Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/mcp-server/get-started?tabs=http%2Cvscode)**

**Tools:** `microsoft_graph_suggest_queries`, `microsoft_graph_get`, `microsoft_graph_list_properties`

**⚡ One-time tenant provisioning** (requires **Application Administrator** or **Cloud Application Administrator** role):

```powershell
# 1. Install the Entra Beta PowerShell module (v1.0.13+)
Install-Module Microsoft.Entra.Beta -Force -AllowClobber

# 2. Authenticate to your tenant
Connect-Entra -Scopes 'Application.ReadWrite.All', 'Directory.Read.All', 'DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All'

# 3. Register the MCP Server and grant permissions to VS Code
Grant-EntraBetaMCPServerPermission -ApplicationName VisualStudioCode
```

> This only needs to be done **once per tenant**. After provisioning, all users in the tenant can use the Graph MCP server by signing in with their own account.

**Permissions (delegated, per-user):**
- **User.Read.All** — user profiles and authentication methods
- **UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All** — MFA methods
- **Device.Read.All** — device compliance and enrollment
- **IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All** — Identity Protection risk detections

### 3. Microsoft Sentinel Triage MCP Server

**📖 [Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/datalake/sentinel-mcp-triage-tool)**

**Tools (30+):** `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`, `ListIncidents`, `GetAlertById`, `GetDefenderMachine`, `GetDefenderFileInfo`, `GetDefenderIpAlerts`, `ListUserRelatedMachines`, `GetDefenderMachineVulnerabilities`, and more.

**Permissions:**
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint API** — SecurityReader role minimum
- **Advanced Hunting** — read access to Defender XDR data

### 4. KQL Search MCP Server

**📖 [Installation Guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kql-search-mcp)**

**Option A: VS Code Extension (Recommended)**
1. Extensions panel → Search "KQL Search MCP" → Install
2. Command Palette → `KQL Search MCP: Set GitHub Token`

**Option B: NPX** — already configured in `.vscode/mcp.json.template`. Just needs a [GitHub PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `public_repo` scope (prompted on first use).

**Tools (34):** Schema intelligence, query validation, GitHub search, ASIM support for 331+ tables.

### 5. Microsoft Learn MCP Server

**📖 [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp)**

**One-click:** [Install in VS Code](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=microsoft-learn&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fapi%2Fmcp%22%7D) — or already configured in `.vscode/mcp.json.template`.

**Tools:** `microsoft_docs_search`, `microsoft_docs_fetch`, `microsoft_code_sample_search`

No API key required — free, cloud-hosted by Microsoft.

### 6. Azure MCP Server

**📖 [Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/overview)**

Install via VS Code extension: search "Azure MCP Server" in Extensions, or install from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-mcp). The extension registers as a stdio MCP server automatically.

**Tools:** `monitor_workspace_log_query`, `monitor_activitylog_list`, `group_list`, `subscription_list`, and 40+ namespaces covering AI, identity, security, databases, storage, compute, and networking.

**Permissions:**
- **Reader** (minimum) — read-only access to Azure resources
- **Log Analytics Reader** — for `workspace_log_query` (KQL against Log Analytics)
- **Contributor** — for write/modify operations (optional)

**Configuration:** Requires `azure_mcp` parameters in `config.json` (tenant, subscription, resource group, workspace name) to avoid cross-tenant auth errors. See [Configure Environment](#2-configure-environment).

### 7. Sentinel Graph MCP Server ⚠️ Private Preview

> **Note:** Sentinel Graph is currently in **private preview** and not available to all customers. If your tenant does not have access, this server will fail to connect — you can safely remove it from `.vscode/mcp.json`. See the [announcement blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-security-blog/uncover-hidden-security-risks-with-microsoft-sentinel-graph/4469437) for details and enrollment.

**Tools:** Entity graph exploration and relationship queries.

**Permissions:**
- **Sentinel Reader** (minimum)

Pre-configured in `.vscode/mcp.json.template`. Browser-based Entra ID login on first use.

### Verify Setup

Open **Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) in **Agent mode** and try these prompts:

| Test | Prompt to type in Copilot Chat |
|------|--------------------------------|
| Sentinel Data Lake | `List my Sentinel workspaces` |
| Microsoft Graph | `Look up my user profile in Graph` |
| Sentinel Triage | `List recent security incidents` |
| KQL Search | `What columns does the SigninLogs table have?` |
| Microsoft Learn | `Search Microsoft docs for KQL query language` |
| All skills | `What investigation skills do you have access to?` |

If any server fails, check the **MCP Servers** panel in VS Code (click the `{}` icon in the bottom status bar) to verify each server shows a green connected status.

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### API Rate Limits (IP Enrichment)

| Provider | Free Tier | With Token |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **ipinfo.io** | 1,000/day (geo, org, ASN) | 50,000/month; paid plans include VPN detection |
| **AbuseIPDB** | 1,000/day | 10,000/day ($20/month) |
| **vpnapi.io** | 1,000/month | 10,000/month ($9.99/month) |
| **Shodan** | InternetDB (unlimited, ports/vulns/tags) | $49 one-time membership: 100 queries/month (adds services, banners, SSL, OS) |

**Token priority:** If `ipinfo_token` is a paid plan, VPN detection is included and `vpnapi_token` is optional. Shodan uses the full API when a paid key is available; on 403/429 it automatically falls back to the free InternetDB.

IP enrichment happens during **report generation** (not data collection), so you can re-generate reports without re-querying Sentinel/Graph.

### Dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Core packages: **requests** (HTTP client for enrichment APIs), **python-dateutil** (date parsing for KQL time ranges).

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Confidential Data** — Reports contain PII and sensitive security data. Mark as CONFIDENTIAL and follow organizational data classification policies.
2. **Access Control** — Restrict access to authorized SOC personnel. Use Azure RBAC for Sentinel, PIM for Graph API permissions.
3. **Audit Trail** — All investigations are timestamped. JSON files in `temp/` preserve snapshots; HTML reports include generation metadata.
4. **Data Retention** — Investigations older than 3 days are auto-deleted (configurable). Archive important investigations before cleanup.
5. **API Token Security** — Never commit `config.json` with tokens (already in `.gitignore`). Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for production.
6. **Investigation JSON Files** — Stored in `temp/` (not committed to Git). Contain complete data including IP enrichment. Can be re-analyzed without re-querying.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"No anomalies found"** | `Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL` table doesn't exist or has no data. See user-investigation skill docs. Wait 24h for initial population. |
| **"IP enrichment failed"** | ipinfo.io rate limits (1K/day free). Add token to `config.json` for 50K/month. |
| **"MCP server not available"** | Check VS Code MCP server config. Verify authentication tokens are valid. |
| **"User ID not found" (Graph)** | Verify UPN is correct. Check Graph permissions: User.Read.All. |
| **"Sentinel query timeout"** | Reduce date range. Add `\| take 10` to limit results. |
| **Report generation fails** | Validate JSON: `python -m json.tool temp/investigation_*.json`. Check required fields. |
| **SecurityIncident returns 0 results** | Use BOTH `targetUPN` and `targetUserId` (Object ID). Some incidents use Object ID. |
| **Risky sign-ins 404** | Must use `/beta` endpoint, not `/v1.0`. |

### Verify Connectivity

In **Copilot Chat** (Agent mode):
- `"List my Sentinel workspaces"` — verifies Sentinel Data Lake MCP
- `"Look up user@domain.com in Graph"` — verifies Graph MCP
- `"List recent incidents"` — verifies Sentinel Triage MCP

In **terminal**:
```powershell
python enrich_ips.py 8.8.8.8    # Verifies IP enrichment API tokens
```
