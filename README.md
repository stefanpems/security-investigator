**Honeypot Attack Analysis** - Assess honeypot servers for attack patterns, threat intelligence, and exploit attempts  

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PREREQUISITE

**Before running any investigation, you MUST set up the anomaly detection KQL job in Microsoft Sentinel:**

### Required: Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL Table

This system depends on a **custom Sentinel table** (`Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL`) that must be populated by a **Sentinel Data Lake KQL Job** running hourly. Without this table, investigations will fail.

**What is a KQL Job?**  
A KQL Job is a scheduled query in Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake that runs KQL logic on a recurring schedule and writes results to a custom table. This is different from scheduled analytics rules - jobs are designed for data transformation and enrichment.

**📖 See [docs/Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL.md](docs/Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL.md) for:**
- Complete KQL job code (copy-paste ready)
- Table schema documentation
- Scheduled query setup instructions
- Anomaly detection logic explanation

**Quick Setup:**
1. Navigate to **Microsoft Sentinel** → **Data Lake Exploration** → **Jobs** → **Create**
2. Enter Job Name, Description and Workspace
3. Choose to create new table with name `Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL`
4. On the query page, copy the KQL query from `docs/Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL.md` modify time ranges if needed
5. Set schedule: **Run every 1 hour (or 1 day to save costs)**, save changes
6. Wait 24 hours for initial baseline data population

**📚 Reference:** [Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake KQL Jobs Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/datalake/kql-jobs)

**Why This Matters:**
- Detects new IPs, countries, cities, devices not seen in user's 90-day baseline
- Filters IPv6 addresses to reduce noise
- Calculates geo novelty and baseline deviations
- Provides severity scoring based on artifact frequency
- Powers the "Anomaly Detection" section of investigation reports

   - Requires: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint API permissions, SecurityReader role minimum
   - **Required for honeypot investigations** - Enables vulnerability scanning and Advanced Hunting queries

**⚠️ Without these MCP servers, investigations will fail. Set them up before proceeding.**

#### Additional Prerequisites

3. **Microsoft Sentinel Workspace** with Log Analytics access
4. **Anomaly KQL Job Running** - See [Setup Step 1](#1-set-up-anomaly-detection-kql-job-required)
5. **Python 3.8+** with virtual environment
6. **GitHub Copilot** (recommended for natural language investigation triggers)

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Set Up Anomaly Detection KQL Job (REQUIRED)

**Without this, investigations will fail with "No anomalies found" errors.**

1. Read the complete setup guide: **[docs/Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL.md](docs/Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL.md)**
2. Copy the KQL job code from the documentation
3. In Microsoft Sentinel, navigate to **Data Lake Exploration** → **Jobs** → **Create** to create a KQL Job:
   - **Name**: `Hourly Sign-in Anomaly Detection`
   - **Schedule**: Run every **1 hour**
   - **Destination**: Create new custom table `Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL`
   - **Query**: Paste the KQL code from documentation (detects anomalies in last 1 hour vs 90-day baseline)
4. Wait **24 hours** for initial data population
5. Verify data exists:
   ```kql
   Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL
   | where DetectedDateTime > ago(24h)
   | summarize Count = count() by AnomalyType
   ```

**Expected output:** Rows with `NewInteractiveIP`, `NewInteractiveDeviceCombo`, `NewNonInteractiveIP`, `NewNonInteractiveDeviceCombo`

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # PowerShell
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # CMD

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Configure Environment

Edit `config.json` with your settings:

```json
{
  "sentinel_workspace_id": "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID_HERE",
  "tenant_id": "your-azure-tenant-id",
  "ipinfo_token": "your-ipinfo-token",

#### 4. Run Your First Investigation

**Option A: Natural Language via GitHub Copilot (Recommended)**

Just ask Copilot:
```
Investigate john.doe@contoso.com for the last 7 days
```

Copilot will automatically:
1. Query Microsoft Graph for user ID
2. Run parallel Sentinel KQL queries (anomalies, sign-ins, audit logs, incidents)
3. Run parallel Graph queries (MFA, devices, Identity Protection)
4. Extract and enrich IPs (threat intel, geolocation, VPN detection, abuse scores)
5. Export data to JSON (temp/investigation_*.json)
6. Generate HTML report (reports/Investigation_Report_*.html)
7. Clean up old investigations (3+ days)

**Option B: Direct Python Execution**

```powershell
# Set Python path
$env:PYTHONPATH = "c:\path\to\security-investigator"

# Generate report from JSON (after manual data collection)
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe generate_report_from_json.py temp\investigation_user_20251201_120000.json
```

**Option C: Manual Investigation JSON Creation**

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the complete MCP workflow with sample KQL queries.

---

## 📊 Investigation Workflow

The system uses a **parallel MCP-based workflow** for maximum performance:

### Phase 1: User Identification (3 seconds)
- Query Microsoft Graph: `/v1.0/users/<UPN>?$select=id,onPremisesSecurityIdentifier`
- Extract Azure AD Object ID (for incident correlation)
- Extract Windows SID (for on-premises incident correlation)

### Phase 2: Parallel Data Collection (60-90 seconds)

**Batch 1: Sentinel KQL Queries (run in parallel)**
1. **Anomalies** - Query `Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL` (baseline vs recent comparison)
2. **Sign-in by Application** - Top 5 apps (Interactive + Non-Interactive)
3. **Sign-in by Location** - Top 5 locations with success/failure counts
4. **Sign-in Failures** - Detailed breakdown by error code
5. **Audit Logs** - Aggregated by category (RoleManagement, UserManagement, Policy changes)
6. **Office 365 Activity** - Email, Teams, SharePoint operations
7. **DLP Events** - CloudAppEvents with sensitive data violations (limit 10)
8. **Security Incidents** - SecurityIncident + Alert join (deduplicated by ProviderIncidentId)

**Batch 2: IP Extraction and Enrichment**
1. **IP Selection Query** - Deterministic prioritization (8 anomaly + 4 risky + 3 frequent = 15 IPs max)
2. **Threat Intelligence** - ThreatIntelIndicators query (bulk IP lookup)
3. **IP Frequency** - Sign-in counts per IP with authentication patterns

**Batch 3: Microsoft Graph Queries (run in parallel)**
1. **User Profile** - displayName, jobTitle, department, officeLocation, accountEnabled
2. **MFA Methods** - All registered authentication methods
3. **Registered Devices** - Top 5 devices with compliance status, trust type, last sign-in
4. **User Risk Profile** - Identity Protection risk level and state
5. **Risk Detections** - Top 5 risk events (unlikelyTravel, anonymizedIPAddress, etc.)
6. **Risky Sign-ins** - Top 5 risky authentications (beta endpoint)

### Phase 3: IP Enrichment (built into report generation)
- **ipinfo.io** - Geolocation (city, region, country, org, ASN)
- **vpnapi.io** - VPN/proxy/Tor detection
- **AbuseIPDB** - Reputation scoring (0-100) and abuse report counts
- **Sentinel Threat Intel** - Match against ThreatIntelIndicators (from Batch 2)
- **Authentication Pattern** - MFA vs token reuse detection (from IP frequency query)

### Phase 4: Risk Assessment (automated)
- Calculate risk score from: anomalies, risk detections, threat intel matches, device compliance
- Identify mitigating factors: MFA enabled, compliant devices, no failures
- Generate prioritized recommendations: Critical (immediate) / High (24h) / Monitoring (14d)

### Phase 5: Report Generation (3-5 minutes)
- Export investigation data to JSON (temp/investigation_*.json)
- Run `generate_report_from_json.py` (handles IP enrichment API calls)
- Generate HTML report with dark theme, interactive timeline, Copy KQL buttons
- Auto-cleanup old investigations (3+ days) to save disk space

**Total Time: ~5-6 minutes** (most time spent on IP enrichment API calls)

## 🎣 Honeypot Investigation Agent

The system includes a **specialized agent** for analyzing honeypot servers to assess attack patterns, threat intelligence, and defensive effectiveness. Honeypots are decoy systems designed to attract attackers and provide early warning of emerging threats.

### When to Use Honeypot Investigation

Use this agent when you need to:
- **Analyze attack patterns** targeting your honeypot infrastructure
- **Extract threat intelligence** from failed connection attempts and exploit probes
- **Assess honeypot effectiveness** at detecting and logging malicious activity
- **Identify novel attack techniques** not yet cataloged in threat intelligence feeds
- **Generate executive reports** on threat landscape and attacker behavior

### Triggering Honeypot Investigation

**Via GitHub Copilot:**
```
Investigate honeypot-server for the last 48 hours
Run honeypot security analysis for HONEYPOT-01 from Dec 10-12
Generate honeypot report for honeypot-server last 7 days
```

Copilot automatically detects honeypot investigations using these keywords:
- "honeypot"
- "attack analysis"
- "threat actor"

When detected, Copilot reads the specialized workflow from [`agents/honeypotInvestigation/AGENTS.md`](agents/honeypotInvestigation/AGENTS.md) and follows the honeypot-specific investigation pattern.

### Honeypot Investigation Workflow

#### Phase 1: Query Failed Connections (PARALLEL)
Execute 3 queries simultaneously:
- **SecurityEvent** - Windows failed logon attempts (EventID 4625, 4771, 4776)
- **W3CIISLog** - IIS web server HTTP errors (4xx/5xx status codes)
- **DeviceNetworkEvents** - Defender network traffic (inbound connections to common ports: 3389, 80, 443, 445, 22, etc.)

Extract unique IP addresses → Save to `temp/honeypot_ips_<timestamp>.json`

#### Phase 2: IP Enrichment & Threat Intelligence (PARALLEL)
- **Run IP enrichment script** - `enrich_ips.py --file temp/honeypot_ips_*.json`
  - Geolocation (city, region, country)
  - ISP/Organization (ASN, org name)
  - VPN/Proxy/Tor detection
  - Abuse reputation (AbuseIPDB confidence scores)
- **Query Sentinel Threat Intelligence** - ThreatIntelIndicators bulk IP lookup
  - Known malicious IPs
  - APT group attribution
  - Threat descriptions and confidence levels

#### Phase 3: Query Security Incidents
- Get Device ID from Sentinel DeviceInfo table
- Query SecurityIncident + SecurityAlert (joined for full context)
- **Critical filtering:** Only report incidents with Status="New" or "Active"
  - Status="Closed" + Classification="BenignPositive" = expected honeypot activity (not a threat)

#### Phase 4: Vulnerability Assessment
- Activate Advanced Hunting tools (`mcp_sentinel-tria`)
- Get MDE Machine ID via Advanced Hunting
- Query vulnerabilities using `GetDefenderMachineVulnerabilities`
- Cross-reference CVEs with observed attack patterns (were attackers targeting known vulnerabilities?)

#### Phase 5: Generate Executive Report
Create comprehensive markdown report with:
- **Executive Summary** - Attack overview, threat intelligence correlation, vulnerability context
- **Attack Surface Analysis** - Failed connections by IP, service, exploit type (with CVE references)
- **Threat Intelligence Correlation** - Known malicious IPs, APT groups, abuse confidence scores
- **Security Incidents** - Active vs closed incidents with benign positive filtering
- **Attack Pattern Analysis** - Targeted services, credential attacks, web exploits, port scanning
- **Vulnerability Status** - Current CVEs with exploitation risk assessment
- **Key Detection Insights** - MITRE ATT&CK mapping, novel indicators, attacker sophistication assessment
- **Honeypot Effectiveness** - Detection rate, threat intelligence value, recommendations

### Honeypot Report Output

**Example:** `reports/Honeypot_Executive_Report_HONEYPOT-01_20251213_150229.md`

**Report includes:**
- Attack timeline with peak attack times and attacker timezone estimation
- Geographic distribution (top 10 source countries with ASN/org details)
- Threat intelligence hit rate (e.g., "67% of attacking IPs matched threat intel at 100% confidence")
- CVE targeting analysis (PHPUnit RCE CVE-2017-9841, Struts2 CVE-2017-5638, etc.)
- MITRE ATT&CK tactic/technique mapping with evidence
- Honeypot effectiveness metrics (incident detection rate, novel IOC discovery)
- Actionable recommendations (immediate/short-term/long-term)

### Honeypot-Specific Features

**IP Enrichment with JSON Format:**
- Honeypot investigations use **simple JSON format** for IP lists: `{"ips": ["1.2.3.4", "5.6.7.8"]}`
- Script automatically detects format (simple vs full investigation JSON)
- Backward compatible with standard user investigation format

**Attack Pattern Detection:**
- Automatically identifies exploit patterns (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, webshells)
- CVE correlation (cross-references targeted URIs with known vulnerabilities)
- Post-exploitation indicators (internal port scanning, C2 communication)

**Threat Intelligence Matching:**
- Bulk IP lookup in Sentinel ThreatIntelIndicators (single query for multiple IPs)
- AbuseIPDB integration with comment extraction (shows attack types and reporter comments)
- APT group attribution when available

**Benign Positive Filtering:**
- Automatically filters out expected honeypot incidents (Status="Closed" + Classification="BenignPositive")
- Only reports active threats requiring investigation
- Distinguishes between successful honeypot deception vs actual security concerns

### Configuration for Honeypot Investigations

**Required data sources:**
- **SecurityEvent** - Windows Security logs forwarded to Sentinel
- **W3CIISLog** - IIS web server logs (if honeypot runs web services)
- **DeviceNetworkEvents** - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint network logs
- **SecurityIncident/SecurityAlert** - Defender XDR incidents
- **DeviceInfo** - Defender device inventory

**Optional enhancements:**
- **AbuseIPDB API token** - Increases rate limit to 10,000/day, provides abuse report comments
- **ipinfo.io paid tier** - Includes VPN detection without separate vpnapi.io token

2. Read `ip_enrichment` array for Singapore IP details (VPN status, abuse score, threat intel)
3. Read `signin_ip_counts` for authentication patterns (MFA vs token reuse)
4. Search copilot-instructions.md for authentication tracing workflow
5. Provide risk assessment based on enrichment context

**Common follow-up prompts:**
- "Is that a VPN?" → Reads `is_vpn` field from IP enrichment
- "What's the abuse score?" → Reads `abuse_confidence_score` field
- "Show me all authentication details for that IP" → Runs SessionId trace query
- "Was MFA used?" → Checks `last_auth_result_detail` field

## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Integration

This system is **designed for GitHub Copilot MCP integration**. The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file provides comprehensive investigation workflows, sample KQL queries, and risk assessment frameworks.

### Natural Language Investigation Prompts:

**Standard Investigations:**
```
Investigate user@domain.com for anomalies in the last 7 days
Run a security investigation on admin@contoso.com for the last 7 days
```

**Quick Investigations (1-2 days):**
```
Quick investigate suspicious.user@domain.com
Run quick security check on external.user@partner.com
```

**Comprehensive Investigations (30 days):**
```
Full investigation for compromised.user@domain.com
Do a deep dive investigation on user@vendor.com from Nov 1 to Nov 21
```

**Follow-Up Analysis (uses existing investigation JSON):**
```
Trace authentication for that Hong Kong IP
Is that Singapore IP a VPN?
What's the risk level for 203.0.113.42?
Show me all sign-ins from that IP
Was MFA used for those authentications?
```

### What Copilot Automatically Does:

1. **Retrieves User ID** - Queries Microsoft Graph for Azure AD Object ID and Windows SID
2. **Runs Parallel Queries** - Executes 10+ Sentinel queries + 6 Graph queries simultaneously
3. **Extracts and Prioritizes IPs** - Selects top 15 IPs (8 anomaly + 4 risky + 3 frequent)
4. **Enriches IPs** - Queries threat intel, geolocation, VPN detection, abuse scores
5. **Exports to JSON** - Saves all data to temp/investigation_*.json (uses `create_file` tool)
6. **Generates Report** - Runs `generate_report_from_json.py` with proper PYTHONPATH
7. **Tracks Performance** - Reports timing after each phase (User ID: 3s, Data: 88s, JSON: 1s, Report: 334s)
8. **Cleans Up Old Files** - Automatically deletes investigations older than 3 days

### Critical Workflow Features:

- **Follow-up question handling** - Checks existing JSON before re-querying Sentinel/Graph
- **IP enrichment reading** - Parses `ip_enrichment` array for VPN status, abuse scores, threat intel
- **Authentication tracing** - Uses SessionId-based workflow from copilot-instructions.md
- **Risk assessment** - Quotes specific instruction criteria for HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW classifications
- **Token management** - Never echoes JSON in chat (avoids token limits)

**See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for:**
- Complete MCP workflow (Phase 1-5)
- Sample KQL queries (proven working, production-validated)
- IP enrichment data structure (JSON field reference)
- Authentication analysis patterns (SessionId tracing, MFA detection)
- Risk assessment framework (when to escalate)
- Date range handling rules (timezone offset logic)
- Troubleshooting guide (common errors and solutions)

### Setup Verification

After installing all three MCP servers, verify they're working:

```powershell
# Test Sentinel MCP
mcp_sentinel-mcp-2_list_sentinel_workspaces()
# Expected: Array with your workspace name/ID

# Test Graph MCP
mcp_microsoft_mcp_microsoft_graph_get("/v1.0/me?$select=displayName")
# Expected: JSON with your display name

# Test Sentinel Triage MCP (Advanced Hunting)
mcp_sentinel-tria_FetchAdvancedHuntingTablesOverview({"tableNames": ["DeviceInfo"]})
# Expected: Schema information for DeviceInfo table
```

**Authentication:**
- All MCP servers handle Azure AD authentication automatically
- Use service principals with certificate auth for production (not interactive auth)
- Configure authentication tokens in VS Code MCP server settings

**Configuration:**
- MCP servers must be configured in VS Code settings (see installation guides above)
- Default workspace ID from `config.json` used if not specified in Sentinel queries
- Graph API calls require explicit endpoint paths (use `suggest_queries` to discover)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### config.json

```json
{
  "sentinel_workspace_id": "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID_HERE",
  "tenant_id": "your-azure-tenant-id",
  "ipinfo_token": "your-ipinfo-token-here",
  "abuseipdb_token": "your-abuseipdb-token-here",
  "vpnapi_token": "your-vpnapi-token-here",
  "output_dir": "reports"
}
```

### Configuration Options:

| Setting | Description | Required | Default |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `sentinel_workspace_id` | Microsoft Sentinel (Log Analytics) workspace GUID | Yes | None |
| `tenant_id` | Azure AD tenant ID for authentication context | No | Auto-detected from auth |
| `ipinfo_token` | ipinfo.io API token (increases rate limits to 50K/month, includes VPN detection in paid tier) | No | None (1K/day free) |
| `abuseipdb_token` | AbuseIPDB API token for IP reputation scoring (0-100 abuse confidence score) | No | None (1K/day free) |
| `vpnapi_token` | vpnapi.io API token for VPN/proxy/Tor detection (standalone service) | No | None (free tier available) |
| `output_dir` | Directory for generated HTML reports | No | `reports` |

### API Rate Limits (IP Enrichment):

**Without tokens (free tier):**
- **ipinfo.io**: 1,000 requests/day (geolocation, org, ASN only)
- **AbuseIPDB**: 1,000 requests/day (IP reputation scoring)
- **vpnapi.io**: 1,000 requests/month free tier (VPN/proxy detection)

**With tokens (recommended for production):**
- **ipinfo.io**: 50,000 requests/month (free tier) or unlimited (paid plans starting at $249/month - includes VPN detection)
- **AbuseIPDB**: 1,000 requests/day (free) or 10,000/day (paid plans starting at $20/month)
- **vpnapi.io**: 10,000 requests/month ($9.99/month) or 100,000/month ($49.99/month)

**Token Priority:**
- If `ipinfo_token` is a **paid plan**, VPN detection is included → `vpnapi_token` is optional
- If `ipinfo_token` is **free tier**, use `vpnapi_token` for VPN detection
- `abuseipdb_token` is always used independently for reputation scoring

**IP enrichment happens during report generation** (not data collection), so you can generate reports multiple times without re-querying Sentinel/Graph.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Core Python packages:
- **requests** - HTTP client for IP enrichment APIs (ipinfo.io, vpnapi.io, AbuseIPDB)
- **python-dateutil** - Date parsing and manipulation for KQL time ranges

Install with:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Optional:**
- **ipykernel** - Jupyter notebook support (for testing/development)
- **pylance** - Python language server (VS Code extension)

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Confidential Data** - All investigation reports contain PII and sensitive security data
   - Mark reports as CONFIDENTIAL
   - Store in secure file shares with access control
   - Follow organizational data classification policies
   - Reports include automatic confidentiality header with generator name/machine/timestamp

2. **Access Control** - Restrict access to investigation tools to authorized SOC personnel
   - Implement Azure RBAC for Sentinel workspace access
   - Use PIM (Privileged Identity Management) for Graph API permissions
   - Log all investigation executions for audit trail

3. **Audit Trail** - All investigations are timestamped and logged
   - JSON files in temp/ directory preserve investigation snapshots
   - HTML reports include generation metadata (user, machine, timestamp)
   - MCP server calls are logged in VS Code telemetry

4. **Data Retention** - Follow organizational policies for report storage
   - Automated cleanup: Investigations older than 3 days are auto-deleted (configurable)
   - Archive important investigations before cleanup
   - Consider long-term retention for compliance/forensics

5. **MCP Permissions** - Ensure MCP servers have appropriate RBAC permissions
   - Sentinel: Log Analytics Reader (minimum), Sentinel Contributor (for watchlists)
   - Graph API: User.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, Device.Read.All, IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All
   - Use service principals with certificate auth (not interactive auth)

6. **API Token Security** - Store API tokens securely
   - Never commit config.json with tokens to Git (already in .gitignore)
   - Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for production deployments
   - Rotate tokens regularly (ipinfo.io, AbuseIPDB)

7. **Investigation JSON Files** - Contain complete investigation data
   - Stored in temp/ directory (not committed to Git)
   - Include IP enrichment data (VPN status, abuse scores, threat intel)
   - Can be re-analyzed without re-querying Sentinel/Graph

**Reports are marked CONFIDENTIAL and should be handled according to organizational security policies.**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"No anomalies found" error** | The `Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL` table doesn't exist or has no data. See [Setup Step 1](#1-set-up-anomaly-detection-kql-job-required) to create the hourly KQL job. Wait 24 hours for initial data population. |
| **"Import could not be resolved" (Pylance warning)** | This is a false positive from Pylance type checking. The code will run correctly. Ignore or disable Pylance warnings. |
| **"IP enrichment failed"** | ipinfo.io rate limits (1,000/day free tier). Add API token to `config.json` for 50,000/month. Or wait for rate limit reset (midnight UTC). |
| **"MCP server not available"** | MCP servers must be installed and configured in VS Code. Check VS Code settings → Extensions → MCP Server Configuration. Verify authentication tokens are valid. |
| **"User ID not found" in Graph API** | User may not exist, or Graph API permissions missing. Verify UPN is correct. Check Graph API permissions: User.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All. |
| **"Sentinel query timeout"** | Date range too large or table has too much data. Reduce date range (e.g., 7 days → 1 day). Add `| take 10` to limit results during testing. |
| **Missing device `trustType` or `approximateLastSignInDateTime`** | Use default values in JSON export: `trustType="Workplace"`, `approximateLastSignInDateTime="2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"`. Report generator handles nulls gracefully. |
| **Report generation fails** | Check JSON file has ALL required fields (see copilot-instructions.md for schema). Validate JSON syntax with `python -m json.tool temp/investigation_*.json`. |
| **Empty sections in report (Office 365, Audit Logs)** | Normal if user has no activity in that timeframe. Reports now show green "✓ No [X] detected" messages consistently. |
| **SecurityIncident query returns no results** | Ensure you're using BOTH `targetUPN` and `targetUserId` (Azure AD Object ID) in the query. Some incidents use Object ID instead of UPN. |
| **Risky sign-ins query fails with 404** | Must use `/beta` endpoint, not `/v1.0`. Graph API: `/beta/auditLogs/signIns?$filter=...` |

### Verification Steps

**1. Verify Anomaly Table Exists:**
```kql
Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL
| where DetectedDateTime > ago(24h)
| summarize Count = count() by AnomalyType
| order by Count desc
```
**Expected:** 4 rows with NewInteractiveIP, NewInteractiveDeviceCombo, NewNonInteractiveIP, NewNonInteractiveDeviceCombo

**2. Verify Graph API Permissions:**
```powershell
# Test user query
mcp_microsoft_mcp_microsoft_graph_get("/v1.0/users/user@domain.com?$select=id,displayName")
```
**Expected:** JSON response with user ID and display name

**3. Verify Sentinel Connectivity:**
```powershell
# Test workspace query
mcp_sentinel-mcp-2_list_sentinel_workspaces()
```
**Expected:** Array with workspace name/ID pairs

**4. Verify IP Enrichment:**
```powershell
python enrich_ips.py 8.8.8.8
```
**Expected:** JSON with city, region, country, org, ASN, is_vpn, abuse_confidence_score

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging in `generate_report_from_json.py`:
```python
# Add at top of file
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## 👨‍💻 Contributing

This system is designed to be extended and customized for your organization's specific needs.

### Add Custom Risk Factors

Edit risk assessment logic in `report_generator.py` (search for `_assess_risk`):

```python
# Example: Flag non-VPN remote access as high risk
if 'VPN' not in ip_intel.org and ip_intel.country != 'US':
    risk_factors.append("Non-VPN international access detected")
    risk_score += 3
```

### Customize Report Styling

Edit `_get_styles()` in `report_generator.py`:

```python
# Change primary brand colors
:root {
    --primary-blue: #your-color;
    --critical-red: #your-color;
    --success-green: #your-color;
}
```

### Add New KQL Queries

Add to copilot-instructions.md Sample KQL Queries section:

1. Write and test query in Sentinel
2. Document in copilot-instructions.md with clear purpose
3. Add to parallel batch (Batch 1, 2, or 3)
4. Update JSON export structure in copilot-instructions.md
5. Update report generator to display new data

### Extend IP Enrichment

Edit `generate_report_from_json.py` to add new enrichment sources:

```python
# Example: Add custom threat feed lookup
threat_feed_url = f"https://your-threat-feed.com/api/check/{ip}"
response = requests.get(threat_feed_url)
ip_data['custom_threat_intel'] = response.json()
```

### Custom Anomaly Rules

Modify the KQL job in Sentinel (see `docs/Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL.md`):

```kql
// Example: Add custom anomaly type for weekend sign-ins
| extend IsWeekend = dayofweek(TimeGenerated) in (0, 6)  // Sunday=0, Saturday=6
| where IsWeekend
| extend AnomalyType = "WeekendActivity"
```
