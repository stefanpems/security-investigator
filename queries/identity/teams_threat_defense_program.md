## Executive Summary

Microsoft Teams is a high-value target for both cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors due to its extensive collaboration features and global enterprise adoption. Threat actors abuse Teams' core capabilities — **messaging (chat), calls/meetings, and video-based screen-sharing** — at different points along the attack chain.

This document synthesizes intelligence from [Microsoft's "Disrupting threats targeting Microsoft Teams" blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/10/07/disrupting-threats-targeting-microsoft-teams/) (October 2025), official Microsoft Learn documentation, and observed threat actor TTPs to deliver:

1. **A structured attack taxonomy** mapping threat actor techniques to Teams features
2. **A prioritized defensive program** with actionable controls across identity, endpoint, Teams admin, and data layers
3. **KQL hunting queries** for both Sentinel Data Lake and Defender XDR Advanced Hunting
4. **A detection catalog** mapping built-in Microsoft Defender alerts to Teams threats
5. **A response playbook** for confirmed Teams-based compromise

## Part 2: Defensive Program — Prioritized Actions

### 🔴 Tier 1 — Critical (Prevent Initial Access via Teams)

These controls **directly block** the most common Teams attack vectors.

#### 1.1 Restrict External Access and Federation

**Impact:** Eliminates the primary attack surface — external users initiating unsolicited chats and calls  
**Effort:** Low-Medium (policy change, minimal infrastructure)

| Action | Detail | Reference |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Restrict external access to allowed domains only | Teams Admin Center → External access → Choose which domains to allow/block | [Manage external access](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/trusted-organizations-external-meetings-chat?tabs=organization-settings) |
| Block external communication with trial-only tenants | Prevents disposable tenant abuse for social engineering | [External access settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/trusted-organizations-external-meetings-chat?tabs=organization-settings) |
| Disable presence sharing with external users | Stops reconnaissance of user availability/status | [Presence in Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/presence-admins#presence-states-in-teams) |
| Disable anonymous users from starting conversations | Prevent unmanaged personas from initiating chat | [Anonymous users in meetings](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/anonymous-users-in-meetings) |
| Require verification checks for meeting join | Anonymous/untrusted users must verify identity before joining | [Join verification check](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/join-verification-check) |
| Configure lobby policies | Prevent external users from bypassing the meeting lobby | [Lobby policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/who-can-bypass-meeting-lobby) |
| Restrict who can present and request control | Prevent external users from automatically requesting screen control | [Manage who can present](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/meeting-who-present-request-control) |

> ⚠️ **Key insight from Microsoft blog:** Many threat actors (Storm-1674, Storm-0324, Sangria Tempest) depend on **unrestricted external access** to deliver malicious payloads via TeamsPhisher. Restricting external access to allowed domains is the single most impactful control.

#### 1.2 Block Device Code Authentication Flow

**Impact:** Prevents Storm-2372-style device code phishing — one of the most effective Teams-delivered attacks  
**Effort:** Low (Conditional Access policy)

| Action | Detail | Reference |

## Part 5: Response Playbook — Confirmed Teams-Based Compromise

### Scenario A: Tech Support Vishing (Storm-1811 / 3AM Pattern)

**Trigger:** Email bombing detected → Teams call from "Help Desk" → RMM tool installed

#### Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Isolate the device** | MDE → Device page → Isolate device (allow Defender comms) |
| 2 | **Revoke all user sessions** | Entra Admin → User → Revoke sessions |
| 3 | **Reset user password** | Force password change |
| 4 | **Disable RMM tools** | Kill Quick Assist, AnyDesk, TeamViewer processes on device |
| 5 | **Block attacker tenant** | Teams Admin → External access → Block the external domain |

#### Investigation (30-120 minutes)

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 6 | **Review MDE timeline** | Check for post-RMM lateral movement, credential theft, payload drops |
| 7 | **Check for persistence** | Startup folder, scheduled tasks, WMI subscriptions, registry Run keys |
| 8 | **Audit account activity** | Review AuditLogs for changes made during compromise window |
| 9 | **Check for ransomware indicators** | Look for encryption activity, ransom notes, shadow copy deletion |
| 10 | **Identify other targeted users** | Search email bombing and Teams chat patterns for broader campaign |
| 11 | **Enrich attacker IPs** | Run `python enrich_ips.py <attacker_IPs>` for threat intelligence |

### Scenario B: Device Code Phishing (Storm-2372 Pattern)

**Trigger:** Device code authentication with anomalous characteristics or risk detection

#### Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Revoke all sessions** | Entra Admin → User → Revoke sessions (invalidates all tokens) |
| 2 | **Reset password** | Force password change |
| 3 | **Review & remove suspicious MFA methods** | Check for attacker-registered methods |
| 4 | **Block attacker IPs in Named Locations** | CA → Named locations → Block identified IPs |

#### Investigation (30-120 minutes)

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 5 | **Review inbox rules** | Check for ForwardTo, RedirectTo rules (post-compromise BEC) |
| 6 | **Check OAuth app consents** | Review for malicious apps granted during session |
| 7 | **Review Teams chat/file activity** | Check for data exfiltration via Teams/OneDrive/SharePoint |
| 8 | **Check sign-in logs for token replay** | Look for same SessionId from multiple IPs/countries |
| 9 | **Verify CA policy coverage** | Ensure device code flow is now blocked for all users |

### Scenario C: TeamsPhisher/Malware Delivery

**Trigger:** Safe Links/Attachments detection in Teams or user report of suspicious Teams message

#### Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Quarantine the message** | Defender portal → Submissions → Quarantine the Teams message |
| 2 | **Check if link/file was accessed** | Review UrlClickEvents and OfficeActivity for access |
| 3 | **Isolate affected devices** | If payload was executed, isolate via MDE |
| 4 | **Block the sending tenant** | Teams Admin → External access → Block domain |
| 5 | **Block malicious URLs/hashes** | Add to Tenant Allow/Block List and MDE custom indicators |

### Scenario D: Post-Compromise Data Collection (GraphRunner / AADInternals)

**Trigger:** Suspicious Graph API activity targeting Teams data or anomalous Teams web client access

#### Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Revoke all sessions** for compromised user | Entra Admin → User → Revoke sessions |
| 2 | **Review OAuth app registrations** | Entra → App registrations → Check for attacker-created apps |
| 3 | **Review Enterprise App consents** | Remove any suspicious app consents |
| 4 | **Audit Teams data access** | Review CloudAppEvents for chat export, file access patterns |

#### Post-Incident (All Scenarios — 1-7 days)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Review and tighten External Access settings based on attack vector |
| 2 | Update Teams Admin policies (lobby, presentations, guest access) |
| 3 | Deploy attack simulation training for Teams scenarios |
| 4 | Verify all detection alerts in Part 3 are active and generating incidents |
| 5 | Add attacker indicators (domains, IPs, hashes) to threat intelligence |
| 6 | Document lessons learned and update this playbook |
