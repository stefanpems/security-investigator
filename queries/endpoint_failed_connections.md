# Defender for Endpoint - Failed Connections & Logon Attempts

**Created:** 2026-01-13  
**Platform:** Microsoft Sentinel  
**Tables:** DeviceLogonEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents  
**Keywords:** failed logon, brute force, failed connection, port scan, blocked attack, endpoint, device  
**MITRE:** T1110, T1046, TA0006, TA0007  
**Timeframe:** Last 14 days (configurable)

---

## Overview

This collection contains production-ready KQL queries to identify Defender for Endpoint devices experiencing:
- **Multiple failed login attempts** (potential brute force attacks)
- **Multiple failed network connections** (port scanning, blocked attacks)
- **Combined authentication and network issues** (compromised or targeted devices)

All queries have been tested against live Sentinel data and use proper column names for Microsoft Sentinel (`TimeGenerated` instead of `Timestamp`).

---

## Query 1: Devices with Multiple Failed Logon Attempts

**Purpose:** Detect potential brute force attacks or credential guessing attempts targeting your devices.

**Thresholds:**
- Minimum 5 failed logon attempts per device/IP combination
- Aggregates by device and remote IP address
- Shows unique accounts targeted and logon types used

```kql
// Query 1: Devices with Multiple Failed Logon Attempts (14 days)
// Detects potential brute force attacks or credential guessing attempts
DeviceLogonEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| summarize 
    FailedAttempts = count(),
    UniqueAccounts = dcount(AccountName),
    Accounts = make_set(AccountName, 10),
    FirstFailed = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastFailed = max(TimeGenerated),
    LogonTypes = make_set(LogonType)
    by DeviceName, RemoteIP
| where FailedAttempts >= 5
| extend Duration = LastFailed - FirstFailed
| project DeviceName, RemoteIP, FailedAttempts, UniqueAccounts, Accounts, FirstFailed, LastFailed, Duration, LogonTypes
| order by FailedAttempts desc
| take 20
```

**Expected Results:**
- **DeviceName**: Target device name
- **RemoteIP**: Attacking IP address
- **FailedAttempts**: Total number of failed login attempts
- **UniqueAccounts**: Number of different accounts targeted
- **Accounts**: List of up to 10 account names attempted
- **FirstFailed / LastFailed**: Time window of attack
- **Duration**: Length of attack campaign
- **LogonTypes**: Types of logon attempts (Network, RemoteInteractive, etc.)

**Indicators of Attack:**
- High `FailedAttempts` (50+) = aggressive brute force
- High `UniqueAccounts` (20+) = password spraying attack
- Short `Duration` with many attempts = automated attack tool
- `LogonType` = "Network" from external IP = remote attack

**Example Output (Real Honeypot Attack - Jan 8, 2026):**
```
DeviceName: <HONEYPOT_DEVICE>
RemoteIP: 185.156.73.74
FailedAttempts: 55
UniqueAccounts: 35
Accounts: ["sql3","openpgsvc","demouser","sql1","user","admin","administrator"...]
Duration: 00:00:05.96
LogonTypes: ["Network"]
```
This shows a **coordinated password spraying attack** - 35 different accounts attempted in 6 seconds from single IP.

**IP Enrichment Results:**
- 185.156.73.74: Netherlands hosting, 31% abuse score, 17 AbuseIPDB reports (RDP brute force)
- 185.156.73.169: Netherlands hosting, 27% abuse score, 13 reports (same campaign)
- 185.243.96.63: Ukraine hosting, 22% abuse score, 6 reports
- 185.243.96.116: Ukraine hosting, **100% abuse score, 2625 reports** (active global threat actor)

All 4 IPs successfully connected to RDP (port 3389) within same time window - **authentication layer detected them after network layer was bypassed.**

---

## Query 2: External Inbound Attack Attempts (Port Scanning/Network Attacks)

**Purpose:** Detect external attackers attempting inbound connections to your devices - port scanning, brute force connection attempts, or blocked attacks from the internet.

**Key Features:**
- Filters to **external IPs only** (excludes RFC1918 private ranges, localhost, Azure infrastructure)
- Focuses on **inbound** connection attempts (RemoteIP → LocalPort)
- Detects port scanning patterns and targeted attacks
- Minimum 10 attempts to reduce noise

**Thresholds:**
- Minimum 10 inbound attempts from single external IP
- Excludes internal network traffic (10.x, 192.168.x, 172.16-31.x)
- Excludes Azure metadata services (168.63.129.16, 169.254.169.254)

```kql
// Query 2: External Inbound Attack Attempts (14 days)
// Detects external attackers attempting to connect to your devices (port scanning, brute force, blocked attacks)
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
| where ActionType in ("InboundConnectionBlocked", "ConnectionFailed", "ConnectionAttempt")
// Filter to only EXTERNAL IPs (exclude private RFC1918 ranges, localhost, Azure metadata)
| where RemoteIP !startswith "10."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "192.168."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.16." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.17." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.18." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.19." 
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.20." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.21." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.22." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.23."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.24." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.25." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.26." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.27."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.28." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.29." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.30." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.31."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "127."
| where RemoteIP != "168.63.129.16"  // Azure metadata service
| where RemoteIP != "169.254.169.254"  // Azure IMDS
| where RemoteIP !has ":"  // Exclude IPv6 for now (mostly internal/link-local)
// Focus on inbound attempts where remote is initiating TO our LocalPort
| where isnotempty(LocalPort)
| summarize 
    InboundAttempts = count(),
    TargetedPorts = make_set(LocalPort, 15),
    TargetedDevices = dcount(DeviceName),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName, 5),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by RemoteIP
| where InboundAttempts >= 10
| extend Duration = LastSeen - FirstSeen
| project RemoteIP, InboundAttempts, TargetedPorts, TargetedDevices, Devices, FirstSeen, LastSeen, Duration
| order by InboundAttempts desc
| take 20
```

**Expected Results:**
- **RemoteIP**: External attacking IP address
- **InboundAttempts**: Number of inbound connection attempts from this IP
- **TargetedPorts**: Which ports on your devices the attacker tried to reach
- **TargetedDevices**: Number of your devices this IP attempted to connect to
- **Devices**: Sample of device names targeted
- **FirstSeen / LastSeen**: Time window of attack activity
- **Duration**: How long the attack campaign lasted

**Indicators of Attack:**
- High `InboundAttempts` (50+) = aggressive port scanning
- High `TargetedDevices` (5+) = network-wide scanning
- Multiple high ports = port sweep looking for open services
- Common attack ports in `TargetedPorts`:
  - **22**: SSH brute force
  - **23**: Telnet exploitation
  - **80/443**: Web service attacks
  - **445/139**: SMB/NetBIOS exploitation
  - **3389**: RDP brute force
  - **1433/3306**: Database attacks (MSSQL/MySQL)
  - **8080/8443**: Alternative web ports

**Interpreting Results:**

✅ **Few/No Results = Good News:**
- Your perimeter security (Azure NSG, firewall) is blocking attacks before they reach devices
- Defender for Endpoint only sees what reaches the device network layer
- Most attacks should be blocked upstream

⚠️ **Many Results = Investigation Needed:**
- External IPs successfully reaching your devices
- May indicate misconfigured firewall rules
- Could be legitimate traffic from CDNs, update services, or partners
- **Always enrich IPs** to determine legitimacy

**Example Output (from test environment):**
```
RemoteIP: 151.101.22.172 (Fastly CDN - legitimate)
InboundAttempts: 21
TargetedPorts: [54207, 52445, 53555...] (high ephemeral ports)
TargetedDevices: 6
Duration: 12 days
Assessment: Legitimate CDN traffic, not an attack
```

**Note:** This query may return very few results in well-protected environments. The real external threats often appear in Query 1 (authentication layer) after passing network security.

---

## Query 2B: Honeypot Detection - Successful External Inbound Connections

**Purpose:** For honeypot servers, detect SUCCESSFUL inbound connections from external IPs - indicating attackers successfully bypassed network defenses and reached your services.

**Use Case:**
- Honeypot security analysis (intentionally exposed systems)
- Detect attackers who successfully connected to services (RDP, SSH, HTTP)
- Correlate with Query 1 to see which IPs succeeded at network layer then tried authentication
- Track attack progression: Network connection → Authentication attempt → (potential compromise)

**Thresholds:**
- No minimum threshold (all successful external connections are relevant for honeypots)
- Focuses on common attack ports (RDP, SSH, HTTP, SMB, etc.)

```kql
// Query 2B: Honeypot Detection - Successful External Inbound Connections (14 days)
// Detects successful inbound connections from external IPs to honeypot services
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
// Replace with your honeypot device name:
| where DeviceName =~ "<HONEYPOT_DEVICE>"  // Change this to your honeypot device
// Focus on SUCCESSFUL inbound connections (not blocked/failed)
| where ActionType in ("ConnectionSuccess", "InboundConnectionAccepted", "ConnectionFound")
// Common attack ports (RDP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, SSH, FTP, Telnet, alt-HTTP)
| where LocalPort in (3389, 80, 443, 445, 22, 21, 23, 8080, 8443, 139, 135)
// Filter to only EXTERNAL IPs (exclude RFC1918 private ranges, localhost)
| where RemoteIP !startswith "10."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "192.168."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.16." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.17." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.18." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.19."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.20." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.21." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.22." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.23."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.24." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.25." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.26." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.27."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.28." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.29." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.30." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.31."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "127."
| where RemoteIP != "::1"  // IPv6 localhost
| summarize
    TotalAttempts = count(),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated),
    TargetPorts = make_set(LocalPort),
    ActionTypes = make_set(ActionType)
    by RemoteIP
| extend Duration = LastSeen - FirstSeen
| project RemoteIP, TotalAttempts, TargetPorts, ActionTypes, FirstSeen, LastSeen, Duration
| order by TotalAttempts desc
| take 50
```

**Expected Results:**
- **RemoteIP**: External IP that successfully connected
- **TotalAttempts**: Number of successful connections (1 = single probe, 2+ = persistent)
- **TargetPorts**: Which services the attacker accessed (e.g., [3389] = RDP only, [80,3389] = HTTP + RDP)
- **ActionTypes**: Connection types (InboundConnectionAccepted = standard connection)
- **FirstSeen / LastSeen**: Time window of attacker activity
- **Duration**: How long attacker maintained access/probing

```

**Interpreting Results:**

🔴 **Highly Malicious IPs (Immediate Block):**
- **185.243.96.116**: 100% abuse, 2625 reports, active global threat actor
- **64.62.156.132**: 100% abuse, 3880 reports, targets honeypots worldwide
- **206.168.34.212**: 100% abuse, 1353 reports, aggressive port scanning

🟡 **Known Attack Infrastructure (Monitor/Block):**
- **185.156.73.74/169**: 27-31% abuse, RDP brute force campaign
- **185.243.96.63**: 22% abuse, password spray attacks
- **106.75.15.181**: 42% abuse, VoIP/port scanning from China

⚪ **Legitimate Security Scanners (Allowlist Consideration):**
- **167.94.138.184**: Censys Inc. (0% abuse, 2507 reports, whitelisted)
- **206.168.34.199/212**: Censys Inc. (100% abuse score is FALSE POSITIVE - legitimate security research)
- **205.210.31.222**: Google Cloud (0% abuse but 5436 reports - likely compromised instance)

**Key Insight:** Censys scanners appear malicious due to aggressive global scanning but are legitimate security researchers. Check AbuseIPDB "whitelisted" field to distinguish from real threats.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Correlate with Query 1**: Did these IPs attempt authentication after connecting?
   ```kql
   DeviceLogonEvents
   | where RemoteIP in ("185.156.73.74", "185.243.96.116", "206.168.34.199")
   | where ActionType in ("LogonFailed", "LogonSuccess")
   ```
2. **Enrich IPs**: Use `python enrich_ips.py <IP1> <IP2> <IP3>` to get abuse scores
3. **Block malicious IPs**: Update NSG/firewall rules (but allow Censys for security posture visibility)
4. **Check for successful logins**: Review authentication logs for these IPs

---

## Query 2C: Investigation - Successful Logins Following Network Connections

**Purpose:** Correlate successful network connections (Query 2B) with successful authentication attempts to identify potential compromises.

```kql
// Query 2C: Correlation - Network Connections → Successful Authentication
// STEP 1: Get IPs that successfully connected to honeypot services
let SuccessfulConnections = DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
    | where DeviceName =~ "<HONEYPOT_DEVICE>"  // Your honeypot device
    | where ActionType in ("ConnectionSuccess", "InboundConnectionAccepted", "ConnectionFound")
    | where LocalPort in (3389, 80, 443, 445, 22, 21, 23, 8080, 8443)
    | where RemoteIP !startswith "10." and RemoteIP !startswith "192.168." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.16."
    | distinct RemoteIP;
// STEP 2: Check if ANY of those IPs successfully authenticated
DeviceLogonEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
| where DeviceName =~ "<HONEYPOT_DEVICE>"
| where RemoteIP in (SuccessfulConnections)
| where ActionType == "LogonSuccess"  // ⚠️ CRITICAL: Successful logins from attackers
| summarize
    SuccessfulLogins = count(),
    FirstLogin = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastLogin = max(TimeGenerated),
    Accounts = make_set(AccountName),
    LogonTypes = make_set(LogonType)
    by RemoteIP, DeviceName
| project RemoteIP, SuccessfulLogins, Accounts, LogonTypes, FirstLogin, LastLogin
| order by SuccessfulLogins desc
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL ALERT:**
Any results from this query indicate **CONFIRMED COMPROMISE** - external attackers successfully authenticated to your system.

**Immediate Response Actions:**
1. **Isolate device** from network immediately
2. **Reset passwords** for all compromised accounts
3. **Revoke sessions** for affected accounts
4. **Full forensic investigation** - check for malware, lateral movement, data exfiltration
5. **Block attacking IPs** at perimeter firewall/NSG
6. **Review audit logs** for attacker actions post-authentication

## Query 2 (Original): External Inbound Attack Attempts (Port Scanning/Network Attacks)

**Purpose:** Detect external attackers attempting inbound connections to your devices - port scanning, brute force connection attempts, or blocked attacks from the internet.

**Key Features:**
- Filters to **external IPs only** (excludes RFC1918 private ranges, localhost, Azure infrastructure)
- Focuses on **FAILED/BLOCKED** inbound attempts (InboundConnectionBlocked, ConnectionFailed)
- Detects port scanning patterns and blocked attacks
- Minimum 10 attempts to reduce noise

**Thresholds:**
- Minimum 10 inbound attempts from single external IP
- Excludes internal network traffic (10.x, 192.168.x, 172.16-31.x)
- Excludes Azure metadata services (168.63.129.16, 169.254.169.254)

```kql
// Query 2: External Inbound Attack Attempts (14 days)
// Detects external attackers attempting to connect to your devices (port scanning, brute force, blocked attacks)
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
| where ActionType in ("InboundConnectionBlocked", "ConnectionFailed", "ConnectionAttempt")
// Filter to only EXTERNAL IPs (exclude private RFC1918 ranges, localhost, Azure metadata)
| where RemoteIP !startswith "10."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "192.168."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.16." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.17." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.18." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.19." 
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.20." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.21." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.22." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.23."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.24." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.25." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.26." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.27."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "172.28." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.29." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.30." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.31."
| where RemoteIP !startswith "127."
| where RemoteIP != "168.63.129.16"  // Azure metadata service
| where RemoteIP != "169.254.169.254"  // Azure IMDS
| where RemoteIP !has ":"  // Exclude IPv6 for now (mostly internal/link-local)
// Focus on inbound attempts where remote is initiating TO our LocalPort
| where isnotempty(LocalPort)
| summarize 
    InboundAttempts = count(),
    TargetedPorts = make_set(LocalPort, 15),
    TargetedDevices = dcount(DeviceName),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName, 5),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by RemoteIP
| where InboundAttempts >= 10
| extend Duration = LastSeen - FirstSeen
| project RemoteIP, InboundAttempts, TargetedPorts, TargetedDevices, Devices, FirstSeen, LastSeen, Duration
| order by InboundAttempts desc
| take 20
```

**Expected Results:**
- **RemoteIP**: External attacking IP address
- **InboundAttempts**: Number of inbound connection attempts from this IP
- **TargetedPorts**: Which ports on your devices the attacker tried to reach
- **TargetedDevices**: Number of your devices this IP attempted to connect to
- **Devices**: Sample of device names targeted
- **FirstSeen / LastSeen**: Time window of attack activity
- **Duration**: How long the attack campaign lasted

**Indicators of Attack:**
- High `InboundAttempts` (50+) = aggressive port scanning
- High `TargetedDevices` (5+) = network-wide scanning
- Multiple high ports = port sweep looking for open services
- Common attack ports in `TargetedPorts`:
  - **22**: SSH brute force
  - **23**: Telnet exploitation
  - **80/443**: Web service attacks
  - **445/139**: SMB/NetBIOS exploitation
  - **3389**: RDP brute force
  - **445**: SMB (file sharing/lateral movement)
  - **135/139**: Windows RPC/NetBIOS
  - **80/443**: Web service attacks
- LocalIP = **127.0.0.1**: Internal service failures (not attacks)
- External IPs + SMB ports (445/139) = potential ransomware/lateral movement attempts

**Why Query 2 May Return Few Results:**

In well-protected Azure environments, you may see minimal external inbound attack attempts because:
1. **Azure NSG (Network Security Groups)** blocks attacks at the perimeter
2. **Azure Firewall** filters malicious traffic before reaching VMs
3. **Just-in-Time VM Access** restricts RDP/SSH to approved IPs only
4. **Application Gateway / Front Door** handles web traffic protection

**DeviceNetworkEvents only logs what reaches the device network stack**. If your NSG blocks port 22 SSH scans, Defender won't see them at all.

**This is a GOOD thing** - defense in depth working correctly!

**Where the real threats appear:**
- **Query 1** (authentication layer) - Catches attacks that pass network security but fail at login
- **Query 7** (IP analysis) - Identifies attacking IPs attempting authentication
- **Firewall logs** (CommonSecurityLog) - Shows blocked traffic at perimeter

---

## Query 3: Combined View - Devices with BOTH Issues

**Purpose:** Find devices experiencing both authentication failures AND network connection problems - likely indicators of active targeting or compromise.

**Thresholds:**
- Minimum 5 failed logons
- Minimum 10 failed network connections
- Only shows devices meeting BOTH criteria

```kql
// Query 3: Combined View - Failed Logons AND Network Connection Failures
// Devices experiencing both authentication and network connection issues
DeviceLogonEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| summarize LogonFailures = count() by DeviceName
| where LogonFailures >= 5
| join kind=inner (
    DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
    | where ActionType in ("ConnectionFailed", "InboundConnectionBlocked")
    | summarize NetworkFailures = count() by DeviceName
    | where NetworkFailures >= 10
) on DeviceName
| project DeviceName, LogonFailures, NetworkFailures, TotalIssues = LogonFailures + NetworkFailures
| order by TotalIssues desc
| take 10
```

**Expected Results:**
- **DeviceName**: Device under active attack
- **LogonFailures**: Failed authentication attempts
- **NetworkFailures**: Failed network connections
- **TotalIssues**: Combined total (prioritization metric)

**Indicators of Compromise:**
- Any results from this query warrant immediate investigation
- High correlation between authentication and network failures = coordinated attack
- Typical attack pattern: Port scan → Service enumeration → Authentication attempts
- Recommend: Review firewall logs, check for successful logins from same IPs, inspect device for malware

---

## Query 4: Aggregated Failed Login Report (Honeypot View)

**Purpose:** Use Defender's aggregated reporting feature to detect repeated sign-in failures with reduced log volume.

**Note:** Aggregated events condense multiple similar events into a single record with metadata about occurrence count.

```kql
// Query 4: Aggregated Failed Login Report (14 days)
// Leverages Defender's aggregated reporting to reduce log volume while detecting attacks
DeviceLogonEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
| where ActionType == "LogonFailedAggregatedReport"
| extend uniqueEventsAggregated = toint(todynamic(AdditionalFields).uniqueEventsAggregated)
| where uniqueEventsAggregated > 10
| project-reorder TimeGenerated, DeviceName, DeviceId, uniqueEventsAggregated, LogonType, AccountName, AccountDomain, AccountSid
| order by uniqueEventsAggregated desc
| take 20
```

**Expected Results:**
- **uniqueEventsAggregated**: Number of similar failed login events condensed into this record
- Threshold of >10 indicates persistent attack attempts
- More efficient than scanning every individual failed login event

**Use Case:**
- Perfect for detecting slow brute force attacks (below typical alerting thresholds)
- Reduces data volume while maintaining detection capability
- Recommended for scheduled reports and automated alerting

---

## Query 5: Failed Network Connections by Protocol

**Purpose:** Break down network failures by protocol to identify attack types (RDP scans, SSH brute force, SMB exploits).

```kql
// Query 5: Failed Network Connections by Protocol (14 days)
// Categorizes network failures by protocol to identify attack vectors
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
| where ActionType in ("ConnectionFailed", "InboundConnectionBlocked")
| summarize 
    FailedConnections = count(),
    UniqueDevices = dcount(DeviceName),
    UniqueRemoteIPs = dcount(RemoteIP),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName, 5),
    RemoteIPs = make_set(RemoteIP, 5)
    by Protocol, RemotePort
| where FailedConnections >= 10
| extend AttackType = case(
    RemotePort == 3389, "RDP Brute Force",
    RemotePort == 22, "SSH Brute Force",
    RemotePort in (445, 139), "SMB/NetBIOS Exploit",
    RemotePort in (135, 593), "RPC/DCE Enumeration",
    RemotePort == 389, "LDAP Attack",
    RemotePort in (80, 443, 8080, 8443), "Web Service Attack",
    "Other Protocol"
)
| project Protocol, RemotePort, AttackType, FailedConnections, UniqueDevices, UniqueRemoteIPs, Devices, RemoteIPs
| order by FailedConnections desc
```

**Expected Results:**
- **Protocol**: Network protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- **RemotePort**: Target port number
- **AttackType**: Categorized attack vector
- **FailedConnections**: Total failed attempts
- **UniqueDevices**: Number of your devices targeted
- **UniqueRemoteIPs**: Number of attacking IPs
- **Devices**: Sample devices affected
- **RemoteIPs**: Sample attacking IPs

**Use Case:**
- Identify primary attack vectors targeting your environment
- Prioritize firewall rule updates based on most frequent attacks
- Correlate with threat intelligence feeds for known attack campaigns

---

## Query 6: Timeline View - Failed Attempts Over Time

**Purpose:** Visualize attack patterns over the 14-day period to identify spikes and ongoing campaigns.

```kql
// Query 6: Timeline View - Failed Logons and Network Connections Over Time
// Visualizes attack patterns to identify spikes and persistent threats
union 
(
    DeviceLogonEvents
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
    | where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
    | summarize FailedLogons = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
    | extend EventType = "Failed Logons"
),
(
    DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
    | where ActionType in ("ConnectionFailed", "InboundConnectionBlocked")
    | summarize FailedConnections = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
    | extend EventType = "Failed Network Connections"
)
| extend EventCount = coalesce(FailedLogons, FailedConnections)
| project TimeGenerated, EventType, EventCount
| order by TimeGenerated asc
| render timechart
```

**Expected Results:**
- Time series chart showing hourly failed events over 14 days
- Two series: Failed Logons (authentication) and Failed Network Connections
- **Visualization:** Use "Time Chart" in Azure portal for best results

**Use Case:**
- Identify attack campaigns (sustained elevated activity)
- Detect DDoS attempts (massive spikes in short periods)
- Correlate with known incidents or security events
- Establish baseline for normal failed connection rates

---

## Query 7: Geographic Source Analysis (Requires Threat Intelligence)

**Purpose:** Identify attacking IP addresses and correlate with geographic locations and threat intelligence.

```kql
// Query 7: Geographic Source Analysis of Failed Logon Attempts
// Correlates attacking IPs with locations and threat intelligence data
DeviceLogonEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| where isnotempty(RemoteIP)
| summarize 
    FailedAttempts = count(),
    TargetedDevices = dcount(DeviceName),
    TargetedAccounts = dcount(AccountName),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName, 5),
    Accounts = make_set(AccountName, 5)
    by RemoteIP
| where FailedAttempts >= 10
| order by FailedAttempts desc
| take 50
```

**Expected Results:**
- **RemoteIP**: Attacking IP address
- **FailedAttempts**: Total failed login attempts from this IP
- **TargetedDevices**: Number of your devices this IP attacked
- **TargetedAccounts**: Number of accounts this IP targeted
- **Devices**: Sample device names
- **Accounts**: Sample account names

**Next Steps:**
1. **Copy IP addresses** from results
2. **Enrich using external tools:**
   - AbuseIPDB (check abuse confidence score)
   - Threat intelligence platforms (VirusTotal, AlienVault)
   - ipinfo.io or MaxMind (geolocation, ISP, VPN detection)
3. **Block at firewall** if confirmed malicious
4. **Check for successful logins** from these IPs with this query:
   ```kql
   DeviceLogonEvents
   | where RemoteIP in ("<IP1>", "<IP2>", "<IP3>")
   | where ActionType == "LogonSuccess"
   ```

**Integration with workspace tools:**
Use the `enrich_ips.py` utility in this workspace to automate IP enrichment:
```powershell
# Enrich specific IPs
python enrich_ips.py 185.156.73.74 185.243.96.63 185.156.73.169
```

## Query 8: Anomaly Detection - Unusual Failed Login Patterns

**Purpose:** Detect devices with abnormal failed login patterns compared to historical baselines.

```kql
// Query 8: Anomaly Detection - Devices with Unusual Failed Login Patterns
// Identifies devices with failed login rates significantly above their baseline
let BaselinePeriod = 7d;
let RecentPeriod = 1d;
let Threshold = 3.0; // Alert if recent failures are 3x baseline average
// Calculate baseline average
let Baseline = DeviceLogonEvents
    | where TimeGenerated between (ago(BaselinePeriod + RecentPeriod) .. ago(RecentPeriod))
    | where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
    | summarize BaselineFailures = count() by DeviceName
    | extend BaselineAvgPerDay = BaselineFailures / 7.0;
// Calculate recent activity
let Recent = DeviceLogonEvents
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(RecentPeriod)
    | where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
    | summarize RecentFailures = count() by DeviceName;
// Compare and flag anomalies
Baseline
| join kind=inner (Recent) on DeviceName
| extend AnomalyRatio = RecentFailures / BaselineAvgPerDay
| where AnomalyRatio >= Threshold
| project DeviceName, BaselineAvgPerDay, RecentFailures, AnomalyRatio
| order by AnomalyRatio desc
```

**Expected Results:**
- **DeviceName**: Device with unusual activity
- **BaselineAvgPerDay**: Normal daily failed login rate (from previous 7 days)
- **RecentFailures**: Failed logins in last 24 hours
- **AnomalyRatio**: How many times above baseline (3.0 = 300% increase)

**Use Case:**
- Detect NEW attack campaigns targeting previously safe devices
- Identify compromised credentials (sudden spike in authentication attempts)
- Automated alerting based on deviation from normal behavior
- Adjust `Threshold` variable based on your environment (lower = more sensitive)

---

## Tuning and Customization

### Adjust Thresholds

All queries use conservative thresholds to minimize false positives. Adjust based on your environment:

```kql
// Lower threshold for high-security environments
| where FailedAttempts >= 3  // Instead of 5

// Increase threshold for noisy environments
| where FailedAttempts >= 20  // Instead of 5
```

### Change Time Range

All queries use 14 days. Modify the lookback period:

```kql
// Last 7 days
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)

// Last 30 days
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)

// Specific date range
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2026-01-01) .. datetime(2026-01-13))
```

### Filter by Specific Devices

Focus on specific device groups:

```kql
// Domain controllers only
| where DeviceName has_any ("DC1", "DC2", "DC-")

// Exclude known noisy devices
| where DeviceName !in ("test-vm", "lab-system")

// Specific IP subnets
| where RemoteIP startswith "185."  // Specific network block
```

### Add Exclusions for Known Good IPs

Exclude legitimate failed connections (VPN, monitoring tools):

```kql
// Add after the initial where clause
| where RemoteIP !in ("10.0.0.1", "192.168.1.1")  // Internal IPs
| where RemoteIP !startswith "10."  // Entire private subnet
```

## Alert Rule Recommendations

### High Priority Alert: Active Brute Force Attack
- **Trigger:** Query 1 results with `FailedAttempts >= 50` and `Duration < 5 minutes`
- **Severity:** High
- **Action:** Auto-block IP at firewall, notify SOC

### Medium Priority Alert: Password Spraying
- **Trigger:** Query 1 results with `UniqueAccounts >= 20`
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Action:** Review affected accounts, check for successful logins

### Low Priority Alert: Network Scanning
- **Trigger:** Query 2 results with `UniqueRemoteIPs >= 30`
- **Severity:** Low
- **Action:** Review and update firewall rules

### Critical Alert: Dual Attack Pattern
- **Trigger:** Any results from Query 3
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Action:** Isolate device, full forensic investigation

---

## Investigation Workflow

When queries return results:

1. **Validate Threat:**
   - Check if remote IPs are known malicious (threat intel)
   - Review successful logins from same source IPs
   - Correlate with other security events

2. **Assess Impact:**
   - Were any login attempts successful?
   - What accounts were targeted (privileged vs. standard)?
   - How many devices affected?

3. **Contain Threat:**
   - Block attacking IPs at firewall/NSG
   - Reset passwords for targeted accounts
   - Enable MFA if not already deployed
   - Isolate compromised devices

4. **Investigate Root Cause:**
   - Review device logs for malware
   - Check for credential theft indicators
   - Examine network traffic for lateral movement
   - Review recent software changes or vulnerabilities

5. **Document and Report:**
   - Create incident record
   - Document timeline of events
   - Record mitigation actions taken
   - Share indicators of compromise (IOCs) with team

---

## Integration with Security Tools

### Export to CSV for Analysis
```kql
// Add to end of any query
| evaluate bag_unpack(Accounts)  // Expand arrays to columns
```

### PowerShell Integration
```powershell
# Run query and export results
$query = @"
DeviceLogonEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| summarize count() by RemoteIP
| where count_ >= 10
"@

# Use Azure CLI or PowerShell to execute
Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQuery -WorkspaceId $workspaceId -Query $query | Export-Csv "failed_logins.csv"
```

### Sentinel Analytics Rules

Convert these queries into Sentinel Analytics Rules:
1. Copy query to Sentinel Analytics blade
2. Set entity mappings (IP, Account, Host)
3. Configure alert grouping and suppression
4. Define incident creation logic
5. Set automation playbooks (auto-block IPs, notify teams)

---

## Performance Optimization

For large environments with millions of events:

### 1. Add Early Filters
```kql
// Filter by specific device group first
| where DeviceName has "PROD-"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
```

### 2. Use Summarize Early
```kql
// Aggregate before filtering
| summarize count() by DeviceName, RemoteIP
| where count_ >= 5
```

### 3. Limit Result Sets
```kql
// Always use take/top
| take 100  // Limit to 100 results
```

### 4. Use Materialize for Reused Data
```kql
let ReusableData = materialize(
    DeviceLogonEvents
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(14d)
    | where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
);
// Now use ReusableData multiple times efficiently
```

## Platform Differences

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Sentinel vs. Defender XDR Syntax**

| Feature | Microsoft Sentinel | Defender XDR (Advanced Hunting) |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Timestamp Column | `TimeGenerated` | `Timestamp` |
| Time Filter | `TimeGenerated > ago(14d)` | `Timestamp > ago(14d)` |
| Documentation | Azure Monitor logs schema | Microsoft 365 Defender schema |

**All queries in this document use Sentinel syntax (`TimeGenerated`).**

To use these queries in Defender XDR Advanced Hunting portal:
```kql
# Find and replace
TimeGenerated → Timestamp
```
