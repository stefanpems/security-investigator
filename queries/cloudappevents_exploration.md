## Overview

This query collection helps security analysts understand the types of events, activity patterns, and security indicators within the CloudAppEvents table. CloudAppEvents captures activities from Office 365, Azure AD, AWS, and other cloud applications integrated with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

**Key Use Cases:**
- Cloud application activity baseline establishment
- External user access monitoring
- Administrative operation tracking
- Geographic anomaly detection
- Impersonation and anonymous proxy detection

**Schema Note:** In Sentinel, CloudAppEvents uses `TimeGenerated` for timestamps (not `Timestamp` as in Defender XDR Advanced Hunting).

---

## Query 1: Top 20 Action Types by Frequency

**Purpose:** Discover the most common actions occurring in your cloud applications to establish baseline activity patterns.

**Use Case:** Understanding normal vs. anomalous action types; identifying unexpected spikes in specific operations.

```kql
// Top 20 action types by frequency (last 7 days)
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize EventCount = count() by ActionType
| order by EventCount desc
| take 20
```

**Expected Results:**
- `ActionType` (string): Specific action performed (e.g., "Set-ConditionalAccessPolicy", "MailItemsAccessed")
- `EventCount` (long): Number of occurrences

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Conditional Access policy changes (monitor for unauthorized modifications)
- ✅ Incident management actions (Write Comments, AddCommentToIncident)
- ✅ KQL query executions (analyst activity tracking)
- ⚠️ Unusual spikes in privileged operations

**Example Output:**
```
ActionType                      EventCount
Set-ConditionalAccessPolicy     1633
Write Comments                  745
UnAssignUserFromIncident        421
KQLQueryCompleted               296
```

---

## Query 2: Application Distribution

**Purpose:** Identify which cloud applications generate the most events and track unique user engagement per application.

**Use Case:** Understanding cloud app adoption; detecting shadow IT; monitoring application usage patterns.

```kql
// Application distribution - which cloud apps generate most events
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize EventCount = count(), UniqueUsers = dcount(AccountObjectId) by Application
| order by EventCount desc
```

**Expected Results:**
- `Application` (string): Cloud application name (e.g., "Microsoft 365", "Amazon Web Services")
- `EventCount` (long): Total events from this app
- `UniqueUsers` (long): Distinct users accessing the app

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Unexpected applications (shadow IT)
- ✅ Low user count but high event count (potential automation or service account abuse)
- ⚠️ New third-party apps not in approved list

**Example Output:**
```
Application                      EventCount  UniqueUsers
Microsoft 365                    2792        3
Microsoft Exchange Online        1818        1
Microsoft Azure                  1280        2
Amazon Web Services              208         1
```

---

## Query 3: Activity Types Breakdown

**Purpose:** Understand high-level activity categories with sample actions to classify event types.

**Use Case:** Categorizing events into buckets (Basic operations, Administrative, User interactions); building detection rules by activity type.

```kql
// Activity types breakdown with sample action types
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize EventCount = count(), SampleActions = make_set(ActionType, 5) by ActivityType
| order by EventCount desc
```

**Expected Results:**
- `ActivityType` (string): High-level category (e.g., "Basic", "Run", "Edit", "Add")
- `EventCount` (long): Events in this category
- `SampleActions` (dynamic array): Up to 5 example action types

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ "Run" activities (privileged operations execution)
- ✅ "Edit" activities (configuration changes)
- ✅ "Add" activities (new objects created)
- ⚠️ Unusual activity types for user accounts

**Example Output:**
```
ActivityType           EventCount  SampleActions
Basic                  4223        ["KQLQueryCompleted", "SentinelAIToolRunStarted", ...]
Run                    2012        ["Set-ConditionalAccessPolicy", "AttachmentAccess", ...]
Interactwithcopilot    71          ["CopilotInteraction"]
```

---

## Query 4: Admin Operations Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify administrative activities and which admins are performing them across cloud platforms.

**Use Case:** Privilege escalation detection; unauthorized admin activity; IAM role changes; compliance auditing.

```kql
// Admin operations analysis
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where IsAdminOperation == true
| summarize AdminEventCount = count(), 
            UniqueAdmins = dcount(AccountObjectId),
            Applications = make_set(Application, 10)
  by ActionType
| order by AdminEventCount desc
| take 15
```

**Expected Results:**
- `ActionType` (string): Administrative action type
- `AdminEventCount` (long): Number of admin operations
- `UniqueAdmins` (long): Distinct admin accounts
- `Applications` (dynamic array): Applications where admin action occurred

**What to Look For:**
- ⚠️ AWS IAM role/policy changes (privilege escalation indicators)
- ⚠️ Azure AD application updates (OAuth app compromise)
- ⚠️ Single admin performing bulk operations (potential compromise)
- ✅ Expected admin activity patterns

**Security Indicators:**
- High admin event count from single account = potential automated abuse
- Admin operations from unexpected geolocations
- Admin operations during off-hours

**Example Output:**
```
ActionType                        AdminEventCount  UniqueAdmins  Applications
List attached role policies       14               1             ["Amazon Web Services"]
Update application.               10               2             ["Microsoft 365"]
```

## Query 5: External User Activity

**Purpose:** Monitor external users (guest accounts, B2B collaboration) accessing your cloud resources.

**Use Case:** Guest account abuse detection; data exfiltration monitoring; unauthorized external access.

```kql
// External user activity
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where IsExternalUser == true
| summarize EventCount = count(),
            UniqueExternalUsers = dcount(AccountObjectId),
            Applications = make_set(Application)
  by ActionType
| order by EventCount desc
```

**Expected Results:**
- `ActionType` (string): Action performed by external user
- `EventCount` (long): External user events
- `UniqueExternalUsers` (long): Distinct external accounts
- `Applications` (dynamic array): Apps accessed by external users

**What to Look For:**
- ⚠️ External users performing admin operations
- ⚠️ External users accessing sensitive SharePoint/OneDrive content
- ⚠️ Unexpected external user domains
- ✅ Expected B2B collaboration patterns

**Security Thresholds:**
- >50 events from single external user = investigate for abuse
- External user + admin operation = high priority alert
- External user + file download = data exfiltration risk

**Example Output:**
```
ActionType                UniqueExternalUsers  EventCount  Applications
Write Comments            1                    705         ["Microsoft Azure"]
Write Datascanners        1                    29          ["Microsoft Azure"]
Search                    1                    8           ["Microsoft 365"]
```

## Query 6: Events by Object Type

**Purpose:** Understand what types of objects (files, folders, applications, policies) are being accessed or modified.

**Use Case:** Data classification; access pattern analysis; compliance monitoring; change tracking.

```kql
// Events by object type with action examples
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where isnotempty(ObjectType)
| summarize EventCount = count(),
            SampleActions = make_set(ActionType, 5)
  by ObjectType
| order by EventCount desc
| take 15
```

**Expected Results:**
- `ObjectType` (string): Type of object (e.g., "Task", "File", "Application", "Policy")
- `EventCount` (long): Operations on this object type
- `SampleActions` (dynamic array): Example actions performed

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ "Policy" objects (Conditional Access, DLP policy changes)
- ✅ "Application" objects (OAuth app registrations/modifications)
- ✅ "File" objects (sensitive document access)
- ⚠️ Bulk operations on single object type

**Example Output:**
```
ObjectType                       EventCount  SampleActions
Task                             2012        ["ListBuckets", "Set-ConditionalAccessPolicy", ...]
Resource                         1280        ["Write Datascanners", "KeepAlive Consoles", ...]
Application                      35          ["Add service principal.", "Update application.", ...]
File                             29          ["FileAccessed", "FileSyncUploadedFull", ...]
```

## Query 7: Geographic Distribution & Anonymous Proxy Detection

**Purpose:** Analyze geographic patterns and detect connections from anonymous proxies or VPNs (potential evasion techniques).

**Use Case:** Impossible travel detection; threat actor infrastructure identification; VPN/proxy abuse monitoring.

```kql
// Geographic distribution (anonymous proxies vs regular connections)
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize TotalEvents = count(),
            AnonymousProxyEvents = countif(IsAnonymousProxy == true),
            TopCountries = make_set(CountryCode, 10)
  by Application
| extend AnonymousProxyPercent = round(AnonymousProxyEvents * 100.0 / TotalEvents, 2)
| order by TotalEvents desc
```

**Expected Results:**
- `Application` (string): Cloud application
- `TotalEvents` (long): Total events
- `AnonymousProxyEvents` (long): Events from anonymous proxies
- `AnonymousProxyPercent` (real): Percentage from proxies
- `TopCountries` (dynamic array): Most common country codes

**What to Look For:**
- ⚠️ **Any anonymous proxy usage** (threat actor evasion technique)
- ⚠️ Unexpected countries (especially high-risk regions)
- ⚠️ Single user accessing from multiple countries in short timeframe
- ✅ Expected geographic distribution matching business locations

**Security Thresholds:**
- AnonymousProxyPercent > 0% = Investigate immediately
- User accessing from >3 countries in 24h = Impossible travel
- Access from high-risk countries (CN, RU, KP, IR) = Priority review

**Example Output:**
```
Application                      TotalEvents  AnonymousProxyEvents  AnonymousProxyPercent  TopCountries
Microsoft 365                    2792         0                     0.00                   ["","CA","US"]
Microsoft Exchange Online        1818         0                     0.00                   ["","US","CA"]
```

## Query 8: Daily Event Trend

**Purpose:** Visualize event volume trends over time by application to detect anomalies and establish baselines.

**Use Case:** Capacity planning; anomaly detection; incident correlation; workload pattern analysis.

```kql
// Daily event trend over last 7 days
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize EventCount = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), Application
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

**Expected Results:**
- `TimeGenerated` (datetime): Day bucket
- `Application` (string): Cloud application
- `EventCount` (long): Events on that day

**What to Look For:**
- ⚠️ Sudden spikes (>3x baseline) = potential attack or misconfiguration
- ⚠️ Drops to zero = logging failure or service outage
- ✅ Consistent patterns = healthy baseline
- ⚠️ Weekend/off-hours activity spikes = potential compromise

**Tuning:**
- Change `1d` to `1h` for hourly granularity
- Change `ago(7d)` to `ago(30d)` for monthly trends

**Example Output:**
```
TimeGenerated           Application                 EventCount
2026-01-06T00:00:00Z   Microsoft Azure             4
2026-01-07T00:00:00Z   Microsoft 365               213
2026-01-09T00:00:00Z   Microsoft Azure             807  <-- Spike detected
```

---

## Query 9: Impersonation Events

**Purpose:** Detect user impersonation activities (when one user performs actions on behalf of another).

**Use Case:** Privilege abuse detection; delegated access monitoring; potential account takeover indicators.

```kql
// Impersonation events (if any)
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where IsImpersonated == true
| summarize EventCount = count(),
            UniqueUsers = dcount(AccountObjectId),
            SampleActions = make_set(ActionType, 10)
  by Application
| order by EventCount desc
```

**Expected Results:**
- `Application` (string): Where impersonation occurred
- `EventCount` (long): Impersonation events
- `UniqueUsers` (long): Accounts involved
- `SampleActions` (dynamic array): Actions performed via impersonation

**What to Look For:**
- ⚠️ **ANY impersonation events warrant investigation**
- ⚠️ Impersonation from unexpected accounts
- ⚠️ Impersonation combined with admin operations
- ✅ Expected delegated access (e.g., IT support accounts with proper approval)

**Security Indicators:**
- Impersonation event count = immediate review required
- Impersonation + data access = data breach risk
- Impersonation + privilege escalation = critical priority

**Note:** If query returns 0 rows, no impersonation detected (good security posture).

---

## Query 10: Sample Event Details

**Purpose:** Get detailed view of actual events for manual inspection and field validation.

**Use Case:** Incident investigation; understanding event schema; validating detection logic; training.

```kql
// Sample events with key details
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| project TimeGenerated, 
          Application, 
          ActionType, 
          ActivityType,
          AccountDisplayName,
          ObjectType,
          ObjectName,
          IsAdminOperation,
          IsExternalUser,
          CountryCode,
          City
| take 50
```

**Expected Results:**
- Full event details with key fields projected
- 50 most recent events for sampling

**What to Look For:**
- Verify field data quality (empty values, nulls)
- Understand event context and relationships
- Sample suspicious action types for deeper analysis

**Tuning:**
- Add `| where AccountDisplayName == "user@domain.com"` for user-specific sampling
- Add `| where ActionType contains "Policy"` for targeted sampling
- Change `take 50` to adjust sample size

---

## Tuning and Customization

### Time Range Adjustment
```kql
// Change from 7 days to other periods
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)   // Last 7 days
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)  // Last 24 hours
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)  // Last 30 days

// Or use absolute date ranges
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2026-01-01) .. datetime(2026-01-13))
```

### User-Specific Filtering
```kql
// Add to any query to focus on specific user
| where AccountDisplayName == "user@domain.com"
| where AccountObjectId == "<user_object_id>"
```

### Application-Specific Analysis
```kql
// Focus on specific cloud app
| where Application == "Amazon Web Services"
| where Application in ("Microsoft 365", "Microsoft Azure")
```

### High-Priority Event Filtering
```kql
// Combine security flags
| where IsAdminOperation == true and IsExternalUser == true
| where IsAnonymousProxy == true
| where IsImpersonated == true
```

---

## Alert Rule Recommendations

---

## Investigation Workflow

### Step 1: Establish Baseline
1. Run **Query 1-3** to understand normal activity patterns
2. Document baseline action types, applications, and activity types
3. Note typical event volumes per application

### Step 2: Security Review
1. Run **Query 4** (Admin Operations) - review for unexpected privileged activity
2. Run **Query 5** (External Users) - validate B2B collaboration is authorized
3. Run **Query 7** (Geographic Analysis) - check for anonymous proxies or unexpected countries
4. Run **Query 9** (Impersonation) - investigate any results

### Step 3: Anomaly Detection
1. Run **Query 8** (Daily Trend) - identify spikes or drops
2. Compare current volumes to baseline
3. Investigate date/time of anomalies

### Step 4: Targeted Investigation
1. Use **Query 10** (Sample Events) with user/app filters
2. Drill into suspicious action types
3. Correlate with other log sources (SigninLogs, AuditLogs)

### Step 5: Incident Response
1. If malicious activity confirmed:
   - Disable compromised accounts
   - Revoke OAuth app permissions
   - Reset Conditional Access policies
   - Block suspicious IPs at firewall
2. Document findings in incident ticket
3. Run queries again to confirm remediation

## Advanced Investigation Query

```kql
// Comprehensive user investigation across all cloud apps
let targetUser = "user@domain.com";
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where AccountDisplayName contains targetUser or AccountObjectId contains targetUser
| summarize EventCount = count(),
            Applications = make_set(Application),

    IsProxy == true, 100,
    IsAdmin == true and IsExternal == true, 90,
    IsAdmin == true, 50,
    IsExternal == true, 30,
    0
  )
| order by ThreatScore desc, EventCount desc
```

**Purpose:** Rapid user risk assessment across all cloud applications with threat scoring.

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Time filters first:** Always filter `TimeGenerated` early in query
2. **Use summarize:** Aggregations are faster than scanning all rows
3. **Limit result sets:** Use `take` or `top` for large result sets
4. **Index-friendly operators:** Use `==` for exact matches, `has` for word searches
5. **Avoid `contains` on high-cardinality fields:** Use `has` instead when possible
