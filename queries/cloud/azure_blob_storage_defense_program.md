## Executive Summary

Microsoft Threat Intelligence published an [in-depth analysis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/10/20/inside-the-attack-chain-threat-activity-targeting-azure-blob-storage/) of threat activity targeting Azure Blob Storage across the **full MITRE ATT&CK kill chain** — from reconnaissance through impact. Azure Blob Storage is a high-value target due to its role in storing massive amounts of unstructured data for AI, HPC, analytics, media, backup, and IoT workloads. Threat actors actively seek opportunities to compromise environments that host downloadable media or maintain large-scale data repositories.

This document synthesizes that intelligence with official Microsoft security recommendations and Defender for Cloud detection capabilities to deliver:

1. **A prioritized defensive program** mapped to the attack chain
2. **Detection & alerting configuration** via Defender for Storage
3. **KQL hunting queries** for proactive threat hunting across Sentinel Data Lake and Defender XDR Advanced Hunting
4. **Posture assessment checklist** for organizational readiness

## Part 4: Threat Hunting Queries

> **Schema Compatibility Notes:**
> - **StorageBlobLogs / StorageMalwareScanningResults:** Require Azure Storage diagnostic logs to be routed to the Log Analytics workspace. If these tables don't exist, enable diagnostic settings on storage accounts first.
> - **AzureActivity:** The Sentinel Data Lake may expose a reduced column set compared to standard Log Analytics. Columns like `Resource`, `ResourceId`, and `ResourceProvider` may not be available — these queries use the portable columns `ResourceGroup`, `ResourceProviderValue`, `OperationNameValue`, and `Properties_d` which are guaranteed to exist in both environments.
> - **CloudStorageAggregatedEvents:** Requires Defender for Storage to be enabled. Available in Advanced Hunting only (use `Timestamp`, not `TimeGenerated`).

### Query 1: Reconnaissance — External Enumeration of Blob Containers

Detects external IPs performing container/blob list operations — classic reconnaissance pattern using tools like Goblob or QuickAZ.

```kql
// Reconnaissance: External enumeration of blob containers
// Platform: Sentinel Data Lake
// MITRE: T1593.002, T1595.003, T1619
// Table: StorageBlobLogs
StorageBlobLogs

    "GetContainerMetadata", "GetBlobServiceProperties")
| where AuthenticationType == "Anonymous" or AuthenticationType == "SAS"
| where StatusCode startswith "2" or StatusCode == "403" or StatusCode == "404"
| extend IsSuccess = StatusCode startswith "2"
| summarize
    TotalRequests = count(),
    SuccessCount = countif(IsSuccess),
    FailCount = countif(not(IsSuccess)),
    DistinctAccounts = dcount(AccountName),
    Accounts = make_set(AccountName, 10),
    Operations = make_set(OperationName),
    UserAgents = make_set(UserAgentHeader, 5),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by CallerIpAddress
| where TotalRequests > 50 or DistinctAccounts > 3
| extend SuccessRate = round(todouble(SuccessCount) / TotalRequests * 100, 1)
| order by TotalRequests desc
```

### Query 2: Reconnaissance — DNS/Subdomain Brute-Force (High-Volume 404s)

Identifies IPs generating high volumes of 404/403 errors — indicative of brute-force storage account discovery.

```kql

| summarize 
    FailedRequests = count(),
    DistinctUris = dcount(Uri),
    DistinctAccounts = dcount(AccountName),
    SampleUris = make_set(Uri, 5),
    Operations = make_set(OperationName),
    UserAgents = make_set(UserAgentHeader, 3)
    by CallerIpAddress, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedRequests > 100 or DistinctUris > 20
| order by FailedRequests desc
```

### Query 3: Credential Access — Storage Account Key Listing via Management API

Detects `listKeys` operations on storage accounts — threat actors use this to extract primary/secondary keys for full data-plane access.

```kql

    ResourceGroup, SubscriptionId,
    Claims = tostring(Claims_d),
    Authorization = tostring(Authorization_d),
    Properties = tostring(Properties_d)
| extend CallerType = iff(Caller has "@", "User", "ServicePrincipal")
| summarize 
    KeyListCount = count(),
    IPs = make_set(CallerIpAddress),
    ResourceGroups = make_set(ResourceGroup, 10),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by Caller, CallerType
| order by KeyListCount desc
```

### Query 4: Credential Access — SAS Token Generation Events

Detects SAS token generation — especially broadscope tokens that could be used for persistence.

```kql
// Credential Access: SAS token generation or usage with broad permissions
// Platform: Sentinel Data Lake

    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by CallerIpAddress, AccountName, SasExpiryStatus
| order by SASOperations desc
```

### Query 5: Persistence — RBAC Role Assignment Changes on Storage Accounts

Detects role assignments granting data-plane access to storage accounts — persistence via RBAC manipulation.

```kql
// Persistence: RBAC role changes on storage accounts
// Platform: Sentinel Data Lake
// MITRE: T1098.001
// Table: AzureActivity
AzureActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)

    OperationNameValue has "write", "Assigned",
    OperationNameValue has "delete", "Removed",
    "Other")
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 6: Persistence — Anonymous Access Level Changes

Detects changes to container access level that enable anonymous/public access — key persistence and collection technique.

    AuthenticationType, RequesterUpn, RequesterAppId,
    UserAgentHeader, StatusCode, Uri
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 7: Defense Evasion — Firewall Rule Modifications

Detects modifications to storage account network rules — threat actors loosen firewall rules to enable external access.

```kql
// Defense Evasion: Storage account firewall/network rule modifications
// Platform: Sentinel Data Lake
// MITRE: T1562.007
// Table: AzureActivity
AzureActivity

| where ActivityStatusValue == "Success"
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, CallerIpAddress,
    OperationNameValue, ResourceGroup,
    Properties = tostring(Properties_d)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 8: Defense Evasion — Diagnostic Logging Disabled

Detects deletion or modification of diagnostic settings — attackers disable logging to operate in blind spots.

```kql
// Defense Evasion: Diagnostic settings modified or deleted on storage
// Platform: Sentinel Data Lake
// MITRE: T1562.001
// Table: AzureActivity
AzureActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)

## Part 6: Response Playbook — Confirmed Blob Storage Compromise

### Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Rotate storage account keys** | Regenerate both primary and secondary keys immediately |
| 2 | **Revoke compromised SAS tokens** | Rotate underlying key or delete stored access policy |
| 3 | **Block attacker IPs** | Add to storage account firewall deny rules |
| 4 | **Disable compromised identity** | Revoke Entra ID sessions + disable account |
| 5 | **Isolate the storage account** | Set public network access to Disabled |

### Investigation (30-120 minutes)

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 6 | **Review StorageBlobLogs** | Run hunting queries 1-18 to identify scope of compromise |
| 7 | **Check Azure Activity Log** | Review RBAC changes, key listings, firewall modifications |
| 8 | **Identify all accessed blobs** | List all blobs accessed/copied/deleted by attacker identity/IP |
| 9 | **Check for data exfiltration** | Review copy operations, $web container writes, cross-account transfers |
| 10 | **Check for malware uploads** | Review StorageMalwareScanningResults for malicious uploads |
| 11 | **Review downstream automation** | Check if blob-triggered Functions/Logic Apps were exploited |
| 12 | **Enrich attacker IPs** | Run `python enrich_ips.py <attacker_IPs>` |

### Remediation (2-24 hours)

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 13 | **Remove attacker persistence** | Remove unauthorized RBAC assignments, SAS tokens, SFTP accounts |
| 14 | **Restore deleted/modified data** | Use soft delete, versioning, or Azure Backup |
| 15 | **Harden configuration** | Apply Tier 1-2 defensive controls from this document |
| 16 | **Enable/verify Defender for Storage** | Ensure attacker didn't disable threat detection |
| 17 | **Re-enable diagnostic logging** | Ensure attacker didn't disable logging for evasion |
| 18 | **Update firewall rules** | Remove any permissive rules added by attacker |

### Post-Incident (1-7 days)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 19 | Assess data breach impact — determine what sensitive data was accessed/exfiltrated |
| 20 | Complete posture assessment checklist and implement gaps |
| 21 | Review all storage accounts in the subscription for similar misconfigurations |
| 22 | Document lessons learned and update detection rules |
| 23 | Schedule recurring threat hunting using queries in this document |
